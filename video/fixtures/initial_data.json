Come this November the Dems are likely to retain the Senate an gridlock will continue, Obama will be able to govern with his pen and phone, the hapless GOP will keep sending complaint letters as their part of having Constitutional oversight of Government.In 2016, Hillary would win the WH. No amounts of money can change the fact that foolish Americans love to vote for icons. Dems are exceptionally good at manufacturing phony issues, like the war on women. They are also excellent at defining what is, what isn't a scandal. Example, Benghazi where 4 Americans died needlessly because of Obama's incompetence, where the President lied to the nation as to the causes to cover up and win an election, where Hillary lied to the victims' mothers as to the cause for the attacks, all that is NOT a scandal according to liberals but Governor Christie possibly tying up bridge traffic for an hour IS a major scandal. MSNBC has been hammering away relentlessly at this for 2 months now to destroy Christie who likely would be able to beat Hillary. Money is not all that relevant."

It's just Bill who owns a tonne of guns, because he likes and collects them.However, there are a whole bunch of people in the USA who have never talked to a Muslim. So, the xenophobia is strong (like it is with some conservatives who have never knowingly talked to gay people or atheists). When someone scary gets a tonne of guns, then that is frightening to some of the same people who would otherwise never find gun collections frightening.The cognitive dissonance must be hurting their brains..."

We already have a very low labor participation rate, and with a socialist increasing benefits to the public, we will likely have an even lower labor participation rate. This will of course be happening while employers lay off American workers due to Bernie's tax plan. People just don't identify with this guy and don't want a more radical form of Obama. The other issue for him is that Hillary Clinton is a woman. While this seems trivial to most people, Hillary will garner a huge percentage of the female vote for being a woman, just like Obama received over 90% of the black vote for being black, and a large percentage of the white vote by whites who felt that \"it's time we give black leadership a chance.\" or \"I'm a part of history in the making by voting for a black man.\"."

But how terrible that #LoserCenk is offended that Trump points out the MASSIVE Black on Black crime in Chicago and other major cities. The Democrats that have controlled those cities for decades have done NOTHING to stop the urban violence, in fact its getting worse. I'm pretty sure African Americans are starting to see the light. They are understanding that part of the Democratic plan of control is to keep those areas poor and violent, and dependent on big govt."

He lost because Jennifer Granholm left Michigan as an unpopular governor, despite being very successful, while she remained popular nationwide. She was disliked mostly because she was governor during the financial crisis and the GOP smeared her to all hell. That's why Snyder became governor - he talked about creating jobs (with a ridiculous Michigan accent), and he cut a bunch of corporate taxes to do so, taking the money from education and by doing things like cutting corners on regulations, ala Flint. There have been attempts to recall him for years."

Then Hitler broke the Treaty of Versailles, invaded Poland, and it took us about 50,000,000 deaths to realize that Hitler was insane and peace was not an option. It was \"warmonger\" Winston Churchill who tried to get the US involved early in the war to stop Hitler BEFORE he invaded Poland, but of course nobody listened to him.Today, we have a revolutionary Iran controlled by radical Shia where even the leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, shouts \"Death to America\".... and we have the same, naive \"intellectuals\" trying to appease them.Congress knows, through history, how to deal with radicals. They can see the comparisons, they know through these last 8 years that President Obama doesn't know a damn thing about foreign policy, and they most certainly know not to form relations with Shiite-dominated Iran."

I would love to see a woman president but I don't want to first woman president to be someone like Hilary Clinton. The Democratic party has left the people behind and become a corporation loving monstrosity. Anyone that is so blindly loyal to the Democratic party is a fool. Hilary isn't running so she can help better the lives of women or anyone else. She's running for the power of the presidency. She's running because the corporations that support her are lining her pockets. If she gets into office she's going to listen to them and not to the people who voted for her. That's why this \"I'm with her\" shit is so maddening. You may be with her but she's not with you."

You combine that with more wars, more corrupt federal government and a ballooning federal deficit that has the potential of imploding into hyperinflation. More guns and random acts of violence and an ineptitude to stop it. A rise in racism fueled by the likes of the donald. Mixed with a corrupt legal system that can't seem to stop the cop murderers. An undercurrent of corporate libertarianism (koch boys) and socialist Ideals on the other end of the spectrum. Everyone in the middle of the spectrum owned and operated by wall st.

Brown attacks wilson in the car to try to steal his gun, to avoid arrest.3. Wilson discharges his gun to prevent brown from stealing it, the bullet his brown in his arm. This explains the gun residue on browns hand.4. Brown runs in fear. Wilson comes out of the car orders him to stop5. as brown is running he realizes he has been shot in the arm, turns around an in a rage charges wilson for hurting him.6. Wilson orders brown to stop7. brown refuses to stop charges wilson to avenge his injury and wilson realizes he has no chance against 6'4 290lb brown8. wilson starts to unload volleys of bullets in browns direction, some hitting him as he is falling down.Edit: if you dont think this shooting is justified, you think cops should have to fight hand to hand with 6'4 290 lb males and basically only UFC fighters should be cops"

They simply believe that the media are trying to smear Trump by *\"taking everything out of context\"*. And it does not help that sometimes, the media really report things that Trump said as a joke. The incident with the crying baby comes to mind that was completely harmless. The media must focus on the outrageous stuff that cannot be explained away. And also, understand that there are 10% racists in every country. That's 30 million in the USA. They can make Trump's rallies look crowded when 280 million people are against Trump. And there are those who just hate hate hate Hillary and would vote for a turd rather than her."

In fact, the plural, \"amendments,\" is sued in conjunction with conventions. Any convention will be able to adopt any number of amendments if it wants to, whatever WOLF PAC says.

Bush probably beat clinton if perot didnt run. Trump is very similar to perot, billionaires who practice conservative populism, eg. other countries are stealing our jobs, etc. In other countries the have run off elections where their is more than one round of voting and bottom candidates are eliminated, which means a 3rd party will not destroy the chances of the political party they are more similar to. American elections are first past the post, in which the party with the most votes wins."

First, that means it's a dumb-ass move for Trump (assuming he didn't do this whole thing for publicity, and never planned on making it at all), and a very good thing for America. Giving that idiot that much power is a remarkably stupid move. As far as the graphic is concerned, honestly, I didn't understand it. Still, if he read it right, this will be a great thing, as there will be no chance of another republican in office till the next election.From what I've gathered over the years of watching presidents come and go, it tends to be an ongoing circle of democrat to republican, and back every 4-8 years. So far as I've seen, the MO of the republican party is to fuck up the country, then blame it on the guy that couldn't clean it up fast enough, then once a new republican is in office, trash it again, and blame it on the democrat he just replaced.I figure, with another 4-8 years of a democrat as president, the new guy's going to have a good running start, as the country is getting better, which (s)he'd otherwise have missed out on. If everything just gets better for a few years, the following election might be very different, as the country has had proof that republicans simply aren't the way to go. I'm not saying democrats are much better, but they're better."

            "text": "\"In libertarian society who protects the unprotected?\" YOU DO. If you are actually so concerned about the poor, needy and unprotected, you should be spending most of your energy helping these people. A lot of times Libertarianism is called selfish, which is confusing because the system forces people to take on 100% of the responsibility. You have the freedom to help the poor, but you also have the responsibility to finance this program with YOUR MONEY. In our current economy, private organizations already do this. FAI (Feeding America Incorporated) is a private non-profit organization responsible for 200 food banks and feeding 46.5 million Americans with a $2.2 billion budget. The people of this company devote their lives to helping people. This is not a government program. If they had the funding of SNAP, hunger probably would've been eradicated in this country by now. You suggest that in a libertarian society everyone is just going to forget about the poor- that's very unlikely."

A bunch of gays or people as part of a group or event get bombed a muslim did it. At some point we have to embrace statistics and not hold out hope that maybe this time a young chinese girl commits an tragic attack. The terrorists are mainstream. The father of the Orlando shooter is a big supporter of Hillary and typically has a front row seat at her events. I would suggest a lot of this stuff is even coordinated between TPTB and the terrorists. Who ultimately is the source of money and arms behind ISIS?"

But if you want to cut that spending, then you have to be serious grown-ups about it. Find out why we are spending what we're spending. There's undoubtedly pork in there. (Pork, by the way, equals salaries. So you can't even scream \"cut the pork!\" without understanding the people who will be impacted.) Another problem is that, under *Pax Americana*, out allies have been able to cut back their own spending. And most of these nations are too small to ever come close to being able to spend what we can. So our ability to rely on our allies is limited by their own capabilities. There there is the emergence of Russia and China - China in particular. China has money, a larger population, territory, and resources than us, and they are every bit as technologically savy as us. The military is one of those areas where we have to keep up with the Jones'.In other words, you can't just scream \"cut the spending! cut the spending!\" You have to go in there and seriously work out where and how much you can cut the spending, and the impacts it will have."

It would be way cheeper and we could take care for all of them, 10-20 times cheaper depending on the source.2. The people would stick together, and the people not fortunate enough to make it into Europe wouldn't stay behind , how should these weak, sick and old people be able to rebuild their country without the young men who are now in Europe?3. All the people who's lives are not in danger and are looking for trouble wouldn't come and all the smugglers wouldn't exist.4. It would be easier to evacuate the Syrian people and then to fight ISIS!I think opening the borders and letting them in is a disgusting and damaging way to deal with the situation, but these just thought about themselves and how great they are if they welcome the refugees with a Teddybear in the hands...."

The communists were trying to make a resurgence, and the democratic  movements were rising. So the oligarchs got a KGB man called Putin to be president, and he basically put a stop to the violence that was happening, a whole lot of bombings. (whether the KGB was causing the bombings is a different story). If Putin had not been handed the presidency, then there may have been civil war, with the oligarchs trying to keep their stolen wealth vs the communists who were trying to renationalise it, and the Democrats who wanted to prosecute criminals."

As long as politics is about stealing from people via taxes and regulations it doesn't matter one bit what the laws are, money will find a way to enter the game and work in its own favour.

Obama's own anti-fracking EPA conducted years-long study and found that it is safe: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/hf_es_erd_jun2015.pdfMountain of evidence from almost 100 studies on fracking that it is safe: http://www.ngsa.org/download/analysis_studies/NGC-Final-Report-4-25.pdfFracking has also reduced U.S. green house gas emissions down to 1994 levels. If you're against fracking you're not only denying science but probably also hate poor people, since it natural gas from fracking has provided low-cost energy for millions of people."

Close off the roads in or out, Close the borders between texas and the other states, Stop all shipments of goods in or out (no food in, no oil out, They have to make do with what they can make in the state), Cut all federal founding (Business welfare, FEMA, Red Cross, Road and infrastructure founding etc) Remove all military (technically the military is federal) Non-texan personal and equipment. And so on. Treat them like mexico (without any tread agreements or treaties yet), And make them have to make treaties and tread deals with us before any kind of tread is allowed or people are allowed across the border. They won't legally be able to secede (and so are legally still part of the country) but we can give them a practical sample of it for a while and see how both sides like it. I am guessing after a short time the normal people in texas will get pretty mad and vote these people out of office and put more reasonable and sane people in."

            "text": "Donald Trump has gotten 3,500 lawsuits on him. Donald Trump didn't even want to pay his hourly workers right. He didn't pay his dish washers, plumbers, painters and construction workers aka. \"UNPAID WAGES!!!\"Trump's excuse was they did shoddy work, well if that was the case why didn't he just fire them? Trump then has the nerve to hire those very same people that he didn't pay for their \"shoddy work\" to do work for other things. Trump has 4 bankruptcies that he said that he got a good deal out of. Trump got a good deal out of those bankruptcies, but many hardworking people that worked for him lost their jobs and healthcare. Trump University got a D- from the Better Business Bureau and he even had to remove University out of Trump University because it wasn't legally a real University. Trump will be going to court in November 2016 for his Trump University scam. Trump Mortgage was a scam, as well and it folded in 1 year. Just like how Trump's wife plagiarized Michelle Obama's speech, Trump's Mortgage magazine plagiarized word for word from another Mortgage company. Donald Trump said that he is the king of debt and he is willing to let America default on her bills and you know that this would cause a world wide depression. Trump said that the minimum wage should be lower. Trump is the worst business man ever. From a Republican website that admits that Trump is a fraud. http://www.redstate.com/streiff/2016/02/29/failure-trump-mortgage-predicts-president-trump-operate/ Trump Airlines-- bankruptTrump Vodka-- foldedTrump Casinos-- bankruptTrump: The Game-- foldedTrump Magazine-- foldedTrump Steaks-- foldedTrump University-- fraud-o-rama Trump is such an out of touch stereotypical, silver spoon in mouth billionaire, that he kicks out news reporters that don't agree with him. That is what dictators do. The free press is there to keep the fire on the President's feat so the power won't go to the President's head and corrupt him. Obama can't just kick the press out just because they disagree with him. Trump is a dictator on a stick and you unreasonable Bernie or Bust people are voting for him. Trump buddies up to Putin. Freedom of the press protects you from government censorship. The thing is that Debbie has been removed and Bernie has gotten concession out of Hillary like the public option. If bitter folks vote in Donald Trump, the world economy will be obliterated. P.s. Trump might not even be a billionaire because he signed up for a program called STAR in which to qualify you have to make less than 400 thousand a year. Please, Spread this around."

Without it, we could only sustain under a billion people. Seeing we are bringing in the entire 3rd world into our civilized countries, it's only going to make us need more oil. At least when these people were in their own countries, they weren't using as much. Also, these migrants love having children. Our populations are going to rise dramatically over the next few years. Companies like Exxon are needed more than ever if we are going to have to care for billions of more people from other countries. It cannot be done without oil."

This is a *big* *faux pas* when it comes to debating...And when someone resorts to this, it shows that their position is very weak...They can't respond with substance, so they respond with a quick personal insult and hit below the belt, just to get a few laughs while using this tactic as a distraction from the actual question. Now, I am no fan of D'Souza; but last I checked, he is not running for POTUS. To even imply that the standard for him should be equal to that of a candidate for POTUS, is fucking ridiculous. Cenk thinks this clip is a \"win\" for him, but to anyone intelligent, it just makes him look like even more of a douchebag. If this was a proper debate, Cenk would be the one being laughed at here. A proper response would have been to showcase all of the times Trump has been found to have committed serious legal infractions, i.e. Trump University."

I would ask a random BLM member on the street how many black people were killed by police this year. My opinion is that the answer (and perception) would be much higher than reality. Because media like TYT are only reporting when black people are killed by police. Propaganda by omission. Then comparing it to population and not violent crime statistics, etc. This Tin Tin Francis character is just sweating righteousness, but it is fun how unaware he is about his own bias. He's talking about how other side is misinterpreting just plain Black Lives Matter as (only) BLM. But he himself immediately considers it OK to misinterpret sign of All Lives Matter as something else (Black Lives don't matter or similar)."

I encourage *everyone*, no matter their political leanings, to never take anything that is told to them at face value, and to trace where the money which went into that statement came from. It is *always* traceable to some organization with an agenda. Anti-smoking sentiment is always traceable to funds and grants intended to show the dangers of smoking, which is marginally okay, but so are *anti-vaping* studies, which is definitely not! Studies which show climate change isn't happening are traceable to *Petroleum companies*, and that's *certainly* a conflict of interest. And studies which say marijuana is dangerous can be traced to a few different groups, and all of *them* have an agenda, as well.If you're going to respond to this doubting my intentions, please... I beg of you... try following the money first. Nobody paid me to say this. Test this out for yourself. Do a little due diligence and see for yourself."

The reason why this country went from nothing to a superpower in such a short period of time, is because our founding fathers were basically badasses who were willing to risk living in the woods with bears over letting someone tell them what to do with their family and their property. Then, great people from all nations saw that opportunity and tossed their lot in to the mix, bringing versitility and all kinds of enginuity into the country and that, combined with the freedom America allowed, has provided creativity and acheivement the world had never seen before. That is the basis of our DNA in this country. What the goal is for you is to delute our strength by bring in as many people who DONT have that attitude as possible as fast as possible and destroy the very fabric of our nation, that which ALLOWS us to do the great things we do for the entire world. A quarter of our workforce is sitting at home collecting a check, or just sitting at home. Now is not the time for mass immigration and inflation of social programs. The country simply cannot withstand it. That is the reality Trump voters (not FANS) understand.If you like being ABLE to help SOME people, stop trying to give away the kitfchen sink to every pathetic convict and welfare case who strolls across the border, or it's over very soon and then you and your friends can try to find a way over to Mexico."

They feel like they are the divine hand of God issuing a form of justice which the broken legal system can't issue (in their minds). The goal isn't inherently political or having the intention to scare or terrorize. They are seeking a remedy to a perceived problem.Now, it's likely these people have extreme psychological issues. I'm not suggesting their perception is accurate. I'm simply saying that it's more religious than political.Also, though this isn't directly expressed in the definitions, I would argue that there would have to be an organization behind it. One crazy person doing bad things is usually called a criminal.Timothy McVeigh was a terrorist. This PP shooter was a nut."

He's possibly the only person in America who can step into that role effectively and set an example for future \"first dudes.\" If Hilary doesn't get to be president, and a different woman later gets elected president, the \"First Dude\" will no doubt have to deal with some mockery from Right Wingers in the media, rednecks, and others who are uncomfortable seeing men in roles traditionally filled by women... But no one could see Bill Clinton as the husband of the president and say: \"That poor guy must feel a little inadequate with his wife in the big chair,\" because he's already been there, done that, and done the interns while he was at it...It has to be Bill the first time it happens, and then future \"first dudes\" won't seem so out of place. But part of me wants to find out that Hilary only stood by Bill for all those years after the affair so that she could later become President and publicly humiliate Bill by getting it on with a young male intern in the oval office and leaking it to the press. One day we'll all find out that this whole \"becoming President\" thing was just a long term revenge strategy."

There are three hurdles:1: You'd have to prove the US gov't. was involved with terrorism. Guess who defines what terrorism is? Remember the whole \"enhanced interrogation\" thing?2: You'd have to provide evidence. The US gov't. operates in greater secrecy than before; any evidence can simply be classified for \"National Security\" reasons and put out of reach. And that's assuming it doesn't simply destroy the evidence and dare the court to do something about it (it's happened several times before).3: Legal immunity. Putting the Statute of Limitations and Sovereign Immunity aside, with Congress generally being useless and SCOTUS deadlocked, the President can simply decree immunity from such lawsuits.Do you really think Obama would have acknowledged the government's torture program or the secret bombings in Laos if there was even the slightest chance it would get sued for damages?"

Some of his supporters are capable of using that portion of their brain, but remember, it is scientific fact, that when someone's emotional side of their brain is being overwhelmed, then the upper brain functions that control rational thought are completely overpowered. This explains Trumps support. Trump, like most great con men, is a master manipulator of peoples emotions. That's why he talks the way he does (with a 4th grade vocabulary so even the poorly educated can understand him, they are unfortunately, the most vulnerable) and says the things he says. It is not by accident. He is appealing (with great affect) to people's emotions, so much so, that rational thought is not possible. This is why no matter how logical you are with your arguments, no matter how you unequivocally prove a point, you find that it is helpless; its just not possible to reason with someone who's upper brain functions are being impaired by their emotions. We can only hope that eventually they realize they are being manipulated. Thankfully a lot of people either consciously or unconsciously realize this and choose to use their intellect instead of their emotion to pick their elected officials; lets just hope enough of them turn out to vote."

It is not surprise your views are divorced from a contact with reality that you imagine they would be worth enacting. ",

            "text": "+sharper68 You don't run any business, a person running a business understands that the entire concept of 'fair share' is a bullshit political spin to steal from him and redistribute to those who see it as unfair that they are not making money, while missing the entire point that they are not producing anything, not producing products, investment opportunities, jobs, investment capital. People who run business understand that the risk that they take with their own lives is something nobody can cover. There is no fairness in business, it's do or die and nobody is (nobody should be) standing there with a backstop for them. Of-course if you are running a BANK or a GM or maybe you are a military contractor in America, then you have an enormous advantage of government working for you apparently, as much as government works for the mob.Unfortunately the mob is stupid enough to maintain the oppressive regime thinking it is getting the benefit but in reality huge benefit flows to the best connected people who run unprofitable businesses that collapse and then are bailed out from the pockets of the people who are ACTUALLY paying for all this crap - the actual people who are paying for all this crap are not the bottom 50% but they are not the top 1% either, they are maybe top 15% and they are the ones who are carrying the burden of the entire fucking country and they are the ones who are being squeezed from all ends, with taxes, with laws and regulations. I am patiently awaiting for the incoming collapse, something of a cleansing that will take care of the current status quo of theft and robbery.",

For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye,\u2019 when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\" - Matthew 7:1-5 \"Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven;\" - Luke 6:37\"Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?\" - James 4:11-12\"And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, \u201cLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d - John 8:7These are ALL direct quotes (as direct as can be since they were written after His death) from the Gospels. How does a person like you decide to IGNORE all these direct quotes and go looking to Leviticus or the Epistles for excuses to place yourself in judgement over anybody else? All you have to do is EXPLAIN HOW. ",

I can't tell you how many people i've heard mention that they want to see a woman become president.2- They view her as having Bill Clinton back in office.I used to be one of those people. I think Bill Clinton was a pretty decent president, especially looking back at how well the economy was doing.I think many people believe that Bill will have a MAJOR impact on how she goes about making decisions.I no longer believe he will have much impact, and can clearly see she is more cold and calculating than he is.She seems like she will do everything HER way, which is obviously going to be quite different than Bill's way.Other than these 2 reasons, there really isn't another logical reason as to why anyone would vote for her.",

            "text": "+HyperOpinionatedOk.  I don't really understand your point.  Yes, a religious person might explain the pilot's action as \"free will,\" which means that God didn't specifically will this event to happen.  But that same religious person might at another time, when convenient, say that a different happening is God's doing (when it is something good) or Satan's doing (when it is something bad).  So whether this was actually a case of \"free will\" for the pilot is not germane to my point.  I'm not a philosopher.  I am merely pointing out that religion necessitates contradictions and hypocrisy in order to explain the unexplainable in ways that will best soothe a gullible public (and bilk them for money).  This is because sometimes random awful things happen that don't fit any convenient narrative, and no one is content to hear that the Ultimate Truth of the Universe, which they devote their lives to worshiping, sometimes just allows random awful things to happen for no reason.",

It is from a publicity photo for a thing and not some attempt to be \"hip\" or \"edgy\" as part of the presentation of my comments.Also, it's always some loophole to make religious nonsense \"explainable.\"  When Pat Robertson ran for president in 1988, he said that God had called unto him to do so.  So was that predestination or divine intervention rather than free will?  If the passengers on the plane had died individually, Pat would have probably said that \"it was their time, according to God's plan.\"  Which means that either God decided that it was time for each of those passengers to die, or that only the pilot had free will to choose to die and the passengers didn't.

They were events he embellished to make better stories, apparently.  Bill O'Reilly uses his fraudulent \"expertise\" on war coverage, etc., to try to shape ongoing policies and to deepen the political biases in his audience.  If I tell you that a group is gaining traction in a few cities in Oman, and that this is a cause worth going to war for, chances are that you will shrug and ignore me.  If I tell you that I was standing next to a group of barbarians who were hacking people to death and raping women, and this is the most evil group imaginable and thus I have been convinced that war is the only option, you are much more likely to trust me, because I am an eyewitness with a firsthand account, so my insight means more than someone just relaying a story from a distance.  O'Reilly isn't some retired old man who is embellishing something irrelevant about the old truck he used to own.  People turn to the network news and the cable news channels to form opinions about our policies, and then they elect officials based upon those opinions.  No one's opinion of the Iraq War will change based on where Brian Williams was.  But someone's opinion of our foreign policy could change if a journalist speaks candidly of events that so clearly paint \"good vs. evil\" that it sharpens the listener's resolve.  It is part of the reason that reporters become famous--because they are there covering events and observing them in a way that we cannot.  O'Reilly's lies are far more impactful.3.  I went out of my way to not be ideological in my criticism of Brian Williams.  Just because you like an anchor or a network or that network's political biases more or less than the alternative doesn't mean that every story has to be drowning in partisan hackery.  I don't care if Williams ever gets his job back, because NBC, just like the other mainstream news outlets (including FOX), is a hack for the Establishment.  Williams, or the next person or the next person, are going to tell the same pro-Establishment lies, and that is the real problem.  Fox will tell Republican pro-Establishment lies, NBC will tell Democratic pro-Establishment lies, and these impactful lies will fly under the radar because people happen to catch IRRELEVANT lies and make examples out of them to boost their bogus integrity.

            "text": "+HyperOpinionatedAlso no.  But you are the one that made this distinction.  There is no reason you had to mention that Williams was \"news\" and O'Reilly was \"opinion\" unless you are using different standards to judge their guilt.  There shouldn't be different standards, because lying is not one of the leeways permitted to an analyst just because he/she is editorializing.I think that O'Reilly's lies are far worse than Williams' in these two specific cases, but it has nothing to do with ideology.  To prove this, I think that Brian Williams' has had far worse lies as a simple matter of course in being a MSM news anchor.  As was mentioned on TYT, Williams brought on retired generals to shill for the Iraq War without disclosing that they were getting paid by defense contractors and had a financial incentive to push for war.  That is MUCH worse than claiming he saw a dead body during Katrina when in fact someone three or four blocks away undoubtedly saw a dead body.  Williams has surely covered issues like Social Security's solvency and \"clean coal technology\" in a 50/50 way (Democrats say this, Republicans say this), when the facts are that Social Security has a giant surplus for 20 more years and there is no such thing as clean coal, and covering them as though there is debate is a massive disservice to the truth.  Surely he must have \"reported\" that Obama ended the Iraq War in 2011, when in fact Bush ended it with his timeline in 2008 and Obama tried to stay longer than 2011 and was rebuffed by the Iraqi government.  These lies are significant because they sway people's votes and affect real policy.  Whether Williams' helicopter was shot at or the helicopter in front of him was shot at doesn't affect anything.  O'Reilly, however, uses his fraudulent gravitas about having been in war zones he wasn't in to bully his guests and present an ideological narrative about how evil some people are, as he witnessed first-hand (though he didn't), and why we therefore need to build support for more war, and look upon opposing views as un-American, cowardly and contemptuous.  This actually does affect public discourse.By the way, in the first three \"real\" lies I cite of Williams, he was/is doing the bidding of Conservatives.  In the fourth, he was/is doing the bidding of Obama.  That's the point--his ideology doesn't matter at all to my analysis.  You just want to a \"Liberal Media Conspiracy\" narrative, simply because you don't like that O'Reilly has done something worse with this spate of lies than Williams did.",

There's more than just religion going on. Or maybe you think America would be more peaceful if somebody dropped a couple of nukes on it. You wanna try?As for Nazi elimination of religion, the SS wanted to eradicate all religions seen as non Germanic. But this was another SS scheme to gain more power. The internal Nazi politics would have  made this thought bubble impossible, because of the large numbers of Christians within the Nazi party. as for Susan Mazur, she is not a scientist, not even a journalist. She is somebody who interviewed some of the people who went to a particular conference in 2010, then quotemined the shit out of them and published it in a book.And Sternberg was removed because he published his own paper without any peer review, he edited the paper himself, which meant that nobody could review it, because he was reviewing it himself and gave his own paper his own stamp of approval. This is a complete conflict of interest, and completely unethical. ANYBODY who did this (no matter what the paper was) would be removed.",

Again what disaster would this bring us with Mexico. What\"s stopping China is that their economy has gone in the shitter, they thought they could just build ghost cities, but there isn't enough wealth in China yet, they are very dependent on foreign markets to sell their goods. So threatening with raising tariffs is one way to get them to stop manipulating their currency and taking back their illegals, since they need our market, granted tariffs are bad economically, but not a bad negotiating ploy. Plus every time there is some international agreement, the US gets stuck paying more and having to comply with more regulations than China and their tariffs are higher on our goods than ours are on theirs. Backing out/redoing those deals or at least threatening too, is a way to make them level the playing field. Now we do need their markets too, so Trump has to be willing to compromise, so we'll see.",

He was virtually teflon in terms of his reputation, whereas Clinton was shit spattered.

He'll be lucky if he's still alive in 4 years, and the only other person with a chance at rallying that level of support is Elizabeth Warren and she's far more tainted than he is.He had a once in a lifetime opportunity to do good on a global scale, and he missed it, and now the whole planet will suffer. No-one who is not a pragmatist has a chance of becoming president, and worse, by building everyone's hopes then dashing them, he may simply have reaffirmed that the system is so rigged that it's not worth participating in.",

We're still using a lot of 70-year-old technology in modern firearms.No, threatening someone is not in itself illegal, as I said.

            "text": "+Mathew ClemenceWe are not an advocacy group for policy changes.  We want for the delegates from the various states to hammer out the details to best solve the problem as they see fit.  I personally have some preferences of what I would like to see, but it is only our job to get this to a Convention.  After seeing the language of the Amendment(s) proposed, it will be up to our leadership to determine whether we'd like to try to get the proposal ratified, in order to become law.  This isn't a perfectly rosy answer, but we believe that if there are good ideas out there, given the absence of corruption by money, they will find their way to the surface, and we are the bouncers that will keep money out of the process while the adults talk inside.  We aren't looking to have a seat at the table ourselves.  Therefore, I can't say that Wolf-PAC specifically advocates or criticizes your preferred solution for allocation of money.  We aren't an ideological lobbying organization.Also, there are lots of issues that we feel can be taken care of by passing normal laws.  The problem is that the system is so drowned in money that people never have honest debates, and (broadly) the people whose money gives them such power don't really want to fix the system, because they get rich from the system.  Voting reform can happen after we get the money out of the system as much as possible, but it really can't happen before we do this, because there is too much corruption.  Rules restricting the \"revolving door\" between regulatory agencies and the industries they are supposed to regulate, as another example, can be proposed after we get the money out of politics, but it has no chance of passing before we do this.  There are other organizations that can try to push for these things if Wolf-PAC disappears because our job is complete.I know of no plans to extend Wolf-PAC beyond the borders of the United States at this time.

Campaign Finance Refrom is needed but it shouldn't be 100% public imho. It should be 1/3 public and 2/3 private with limits on how much per person or organization. That should be the law.2. What happens afterwards? Does this go to other countries that need the same treatment? The USA needs more refrom than this like Voting Refrom, Secession, etc. Does PAC just die off or continue?",

There was a lot in last Friday's that killed me, because I know there are a lot of people in our country that thank like these idiots, which is part of the reason why we have these stupid policies.  There was this one video about \"The Patriot Nurse\".  OMFG.  A real nurse that is pro anti-vaccination., and the reasons weren't scientific, they mostly had to do with freedom of choice.  Well yeah you have the freedom to be a huge fucking idiot, yeah, but it doesn't mean you should......I wanted to cry.

Take away the legal incentive and the problem is mitigated and our leaders are incentiveized to work for us and not the highest bidder.  Tearing down the government might be a treasured goal of yours but the solution is throwing out the baby with the bathwater and has it's own innate problems that are undesirable as well.  It also does not address the critical problem of corruption except to take away all rules and is akin to firing the cops to solve a crime wave.  What you ague for is the eventual dreamland for the people who are now twisting law to serve them with investments in lobbying and buying leaders that pays off  then fold.

I responded to a specific claim you made, and clarified that Trump's tax plan severely cuts revenue, and provides a huge tax cut that by far and way benefits the rich most. You are welcome to wallow in whatever pleasure you might derive from the misapprehension that you're won some sort of victory. I'm willing to learn more about economics, but your method of pulling out assorted claims and articles that imply caricatures of economics (e.g. some given income tax level that is universally the \"best\") is just laughable.

I've watched lots of interviews with Assange, and while I've admired a lot of things that he's done, he's also turned into a cult figure who seems to be setting himself up as some sort of oracle. I'm aware of the conspiracy theory surrounding Hillary - that's just what it is. I just don't believe that she is an evil person. Circumstantial evidence isn't facts, sorry man. Just my opinion, it's not about what she has done or not done, it's about will the country survive 4 years of HRC - yes. Will it survive 4 years of Trump? Maybe, but with Trump at the helm, there would be so much inner squabbling that it would leave the country vulnerable to enemies.",

Some of his foreign policy ideas are pretty reasonable, but he also was staunchly against cooperating with as a nuclear power, and he voted against encouraging the UN to adopt a uniform code of conduct for all of its members, as well as wanted to continue payment of $244mil to the UN Human Rights Commission, despite the USA not hsving a seat at the commission at the time.",

Often, believing other people won't vote for someone will make people not want to waste their vote on a lost cause, for instance. And since really usually republican and democrat agendas are so similar in perception and in deed (just with a different rethorical package) this PR edge becomes all that matters. So yeah, sure, the system depends largely on the absence of hope, solidarity and real alternatives, but you wouldn't believe that they dont put a lot of money into ensuring that also, would you?",

I thought I was going to vote for Hillary Clinton before, but she made it more and more difficult with her deep corruption. Donald Trump is going to make the right wing look terrible or he will prove to be a NY progressive like he was 5-10 years ago...where he was for single payer healthcate, and not to mention his false fight against the war in Iraq and money in politics. Yes, Trump is marginally better with money in politics than Hillary. I hope Hillary Clinton proves me wrong during the general. I really want to vote for her if she doesn't switch her current Bernie - borrowed positions.",

Where's the failure you speak of? N. Korea only makes threats of war.

Are you sure you've even been to Korea?South Korea signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the 1970's. The only way S. Korea could fully develop a nuclear weapons program is if the US or some other foreign power gave it help. And they wouldn't get it. Nuclear weapons building is far more complex than the average person thinks. But who do you think paid for S. Korea's economic and military reconstruction after the war?  They didn't do it on their own.And S. Korea only really became a democracy in the past 20 years. Many S. Koreans who wanted a unified Korea were oppressed, jailed, or bullied for speaking out. In the 1980's, the government used economic terrorism to crack down on areas that were politically liberal. The government withheld money to districts and intentionally kept people underdeveloped and poor. Thanks to the US, and presidents like Reagan, S. Korea was autocratic for decades.South Korea is far from vulnerable, Einstein. The US's nuclear submarine fleet could launch a weapon on North Korea in minutes. Placing ground nukes in S.

Now that we've determined our friendship, you're more than welcome to open-up about it with me. For one thing, whoever pushed your shit up your ass is a bad-man. It's not your fault and does not make you a dirty-little-boy. Your method of therapy -- posting comments here, to expel your rage -- may feel good, initially, but you need long-term healing. I wish you the best.",

There are a number of levels on which you failed here:Firstly, the Library of Economics and Liberty has an ideological agenda that goes directly against the kinds of regulations that would be necessary to reduce our CO2 output. In what world is this a non-biased source?Secondly, I asked for a peer reviewed paper, this is just what some guy posed on his political website.Thirdly you misunderstood my request. I didn't ask for a source where the consensus figure is debunked, I asked you for a climate research paper that disputes that man made warming doesn't happen. If there's no consensus, as you claim, then the scientific literature should be full of them. Lastly, the article you referenced is absurd to begin with. The study it's referring to examined the positions of climate scientists in their abstract. Turns out that most of them didn't say anything about whether man made global warming is real. Does that mean they don't hold the view? Of course not. It would be absurd for them to have to state this well known fact in every single abstract of a climate science paper. Should they also have to state the fact that water can exist as a solid, liquid and gas? The article states that \"so 64 out of 11,944, or 0.5%, take the view that humans are the main cause of global warming.\" Okay if this biased bullshit is correct, please.. show me some damn climate papers that go against the purported consensus. There should be dozens or hundreds out there if you're right (there aren't, you aren't ).Please do try again.",

There will be nothing pre planned in a Trump debate.Second, it's Trump. We saw what he did to 16 other gop candidates, to think that he would hold back on anything at all is a misconception. He will play the \"corrupt Hillary\" card and win with it because it is an entirely legitimate card to play, and there is just so much ammunition.And as for policy, Trump has clearly outlined his position on several key issues, although I agree the debate won't involve very much policy at all.

Did my point go straight through your head?Further, the two party system is the most stable democratic system because it discourages radical minor parties. We've already practiced multi-partying in the early years of our country, and we learned quickly that it led to political instability. Even in the 21st century we've seen countries like Italy experiment with multi-partying and the result was chaos.Fact of the matter is that it is EASIER to govern two parties because two parties build off of one another as opposed to a web of different parties trying to push their own agendas. Just take a look at the last decade of political candidates. Obama, Mitt Romney, Clinton, and even Trump.... they are all, to some degree, moderates. They have all taken ideas from the opposing party. Hell, even the farthest left of progressives in the Green Party should be able to hold a candle to Ronald Reagan for ratifying the single most significant treaty for reducing GLOBAL carbon emissions.",

Trump's campaign started with a lie (remember how all those 'supporters' at his announcement speech were really just paid actors who were given like 50 bucks?), and the only thing that's changed so far is who he's lying to, and what he's lying about. I totally agree that Ted Cruz's odds were totally skewed by the RNC as a desperate attempt to shore up a candidate they could control, but that's faint praise to Trump; who's landslide isn't based on sound policy or professional competency, but a national shell game and a conman's charisma (if that's what you want to call his personality).I'm not even being harsh to Trump, I'm actually being pretty restrained, given that his behavior in debates is pretty well established.  You have a debate moderator for the same reason you have a crossing guard at an intersection when kids are leaving to go home:  you can't trust the drivers to act correctly of their recognizance.  You have a debate moderator to keep things on point from a supposed objective stance, so that it doesn't degenerate into the same kind of vile nonsense that all the poorly moderated debates came to.  You have a debate moderator for the same reason you have posted guards: it keeps the people honest, so they're not tempted to act badly.Given how bad this cycle's been on both sides, to go without a moderator is essentially saying that the logical course of action is to give Hillary and Donald stilettos and lash their offhand wrists together, then let them duke it out with the last one standing being declared the winner: that's the level of discourse you're going to get with just those two.

It is like saying \"Because I need milk, I am going to go to the store to buy milk.\"  It is true that I suppose I could go and buy milk for no reason, thus making the second half independent, but the implication is that the second half would be irrelevant without the first.  I wouldn't go to the store to buy milk if it wasn't necessary to do so.  The right to bear arms was put into the Bill of Rights because it was more convenient for people in militias to store their guns in their homes rather than in a communal place, and it was preferred that there would be no standing army at the time, so convenience for a well-regulated militia impelled this right.  Today, the equivalent concept would be a police force (which is armed), not simply every individual citizen.   Also, we have an epidemic of gun violence in the US, and just as the First Amendment is not absolute and we can carve out exceptions for imminent public safety (\"fire in a crowded theatre\"), we should be able to do the same for the Second Amendment (and all Amendments), since it is causing a public safety hazard.",

They are not dependent on each other. Nor has the intent of writing ever given any indication that they are dependent.So why are they in the same sentience? Because grammar.

With that said, it doesn't matter if he has one gun or 30 guns. The fact that you'd even include a number like that makes me question if you're just fear mongering. If he does have 30 guns, he's probably a collector that those guns are likely antiques.",

The single reason anybody buys these bills is because they are super short term, the Fed is loaded with long term bonds and can never unload them at all without massively raising interest rates and crushing the bond market. USA cannot repay its debts under any circumstances not because of the nearly 20Trillion Treasury debt but because pretty much the entire USA bond market is pretty much Federal debt, that number is more than 10 times as large. Besides, USA doesn't have any economy that can actually repay any of it and this debt is what is preventing normal rate of return, since the Fed manipulates the rates to keep rates down. Under these circumstances it is impossible to restart USA economy, there are no legitimate savings in the system, there is too much government control and nobody can or even wants to save, it's impossible. Without savings there is no real lending for any real business, the only lending that is happening is happening because of the inflation (printed money) hitting the casin... stock market, bond market, housing market, education debt market, every market.Trump is correct, he *accidentally* stumbled into being correct but whatever, I'll take that.

He knows nothing and I mean nothing about the Bible yet he constantly makes the claim to. Lies and more lies about what the Bible says. Then we get the constant stories about the Bible, Christians, etc.. that are lies. Atheist divorces vs. Christian divorces. Atheists have had less (according to fat boy), so they are so moral. Research everything this old dude says, because it's garbage! I did the research and made sure I went to HIS source. Not true. The atheist site that he used said that the Christians who reported being divorced were divorced BEFORE they were Christian. You know fat boy read that little fact but decided to leave it out of his report and spin it his way. Lied! He does this with everything. I don't like the guy and it's because he is so dishonest.

Being the stupidest person on the internet is like being valedictorian at Harvard. It's actually a pretty impressive accomplishment. Kudos to you.Either a story has a 1st hand source: like someone who is in the room with Trump who says he heard it first hand or a doctor who delivered Obama in Kenya and admits to falsifying his birth certificate or ALL SOURCES are 2nd-hand. So if the 2nd-hand source for this story is not legitimate to you then the 2nd-hand source for Trump's birther story is also not legit. Otherwise you're a partisan hack and a tragically sad troll and smart folks like me will call you out on it. LOL #TotalMoron  ",

            "text": "+Edward Bernayse666 It's the perfect analogy. Germany was also weak compared to the US and UK. Most of Hitler's reign comprised of designing a giant wall of concrete gun towers which evidently proved useless. Hitler was a terrible, young leader who merely frightened his opponents into submission with his insane invasion until his inevitable fall against UK and USA.With the failed appeasement attempt by Neville Chamberlain, I was referring to the Munich Agreement. Germany was received annexed portions of Czechoslovakia and time to prepare for their invasion of Poland.As Chamberlain quoted:\"We, the German F\u00fchrer and Chancellor, and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting today and are agreed in recognizing that the question of Anglo-German relations is of the first importance for our two countries and for Europe. We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.\" The Munich Agreement is the worst attempt at appeasement in the history of foreign policy, and Chamberlain's successor, Winston Churchill, the classic \"warmonger\", was the world's strongest leader of the 20th century.Chamberlain underestimated Hitler's insanity, and now all the leftist who turn their heads and IGNORE the chants \"Death to America. Death to Israel.\" are ignoring the insanity of Iranian Shiite leadership.",

It took the west years to get rid of backwards religion and in return we got free speech and the right to be yourself. Why do you want to put that all at risk for the sake of \"economic migrants\"? And why not force saudi Arabia and press them on their morality and demand that they take those migrants in. I'm sure the European governments are willing to contribute funds for such a project. Not only are they better of culture wise, but they will have a better chance of living a productive life instead of a life on welfare. Not saying that all migrants are coming for welfare but its a fact that a big proportion of them will end up on welfare simply because they are not suited for the western job market.",

Obama used austerity and moderate tax increases. Of course, Clinton will have to increase taxes. If Trump says he wouldn't, he's stupid or a lair. He'd have to. The US can't have 16 years of tax cuts and expenditures and not eventually increase taxes. The question is who is more likely to increase taxes on the wealthy, the ones who don't pay their fair share. Trump's a republican, so his party will never even pass a bill increasing taxes.The other stuff you said is just regurgitated lies. And Trumps is the one who has barely campaigned. Rallies are great, but Trump has no or little ground staff in most states. He only recently started buying TV ads. And as a result, he's behind in the key swing states. He fired his campaign staff last week, and his new manager admits that he's behind. All signs point to #loserdonald",

Then as things die down months or years later, all of those promises, bills and money quickly vanish, and we're back in the same position as we were when it all began.There are certain statistics you don't want to play with, because there's no need to. Allowing known extremist Muslims to actually have churches here in the US is like saying that you only have a 1 in 700,000 chance to be struck by lightning while running around outside in a thunder storm with a huge metal rod sticking up. Just because the statistic is there, doesn't mean you want to go inviting trouble.",

Because in the former case, you should want the mandate expanded to give coverage for more things you want, not shrunk. In the latter case, I want to be clear in saying that this \"mandate\" makes it so employers have to provide insurance to employees, which is separate from Medicaid.",

That doesn't mean the terms of the contract can't be changed, just that that is the way it is right now.And just saying, female sterilization procedures tend to be A LOT more expensive than vasectomies, and birth control pills are not cheap either, that is why they are part of the ACA mandate. A Vasectomy costs at most $1000, but a female sterilization procedure costs at a minimum $1500, and can cost up to $6000. Besides, I would not be surprised if the ACA requires erectile dysfunction to be covered under those insurance plans, and if a \"male birth control pill\" were ever invented and made easily available, and if it were as expensive as female birth control, it would surely become part of the mandate (the only obstacle, really, would be getting Congress to update the mandate, but they would resist any kind of addition to the ACA regardless of what it is anyway)Now, have anything to say about my comment on embryos?",

The laws are also such that it's easier to use what's come before and use it again to be creative, and it's very hard for larger companies to block the creation of smaller ones.

Does this make you more or less likely to support him?Hillary Clinton supported the Wall Street bailout and big banks have given her over $1.6 million dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees. Does this make you more or less likely to support her?",

What I did bring to light is the hypocrisy in your words, and your arrogance to think you're justified to have such a stance. All you have done is prove my point that your case of Tim Cook equates to all gay people having it made is pure ignorance. You've also set out on a path of assumptions based on what one could only guess is your prejudices. When have I ever disclosed my race or gender during our discussion? Yet you feel more than free to blindly project hate that's based on preconceived notions in your mind in attempt to discredit me. You have nothing substantive to add to this discussion.  ",

We also have solar concentrated in some areas but not others for the same reason (http://www.climatecentral.org/news/eastern-us-solar-development-18714).But the biggest difference is that we have much higher population per acre than Denmark has (as I pointed out) and they are concentrated in cities. It would be easy enough to provide renewable energy to every rural site in America, no problem, but the energy requirements in those cities create a hurdle that Denmark doesn't have to deal with.It's apples and oranges.",

You'd expect prices to go up more or less evenly across the board, so your example really doesn't apply here.\"why are people accepting such low paying jobs?  Get some skills instead of complaining to the government.\" Well, what would happen if they all did? You'd massively increase the supply of the skilled/educated workforce while destroying the supply of menial labor. If you wanna look at simple supply/demand, well then you've effectively got a rise in minimum wage and a fall in wages of skilled labor.",

In all of those cases, politicians needed money to run campaigns, and it turns out that all of the winners were humans. So yes, it is possible to clean up this system considerably even if it not totally. Wolf-PAC's Amendment would likely make funding public instead of private, which doesn't mean that money would cease to exist, it just means that 800 people wouldn't buy up every politician like they do now. Would the rich still seek ways to unduly influence politicians? I'm sure they would, but giving them large campaign donations would no longer be legal, and prison does seem to be a half-decent impediment to human greed.",

            "text": "+Lineage2MediaCom no facts from you and just ad hominem attacks?michael brown didnt surrender according to the Department of Justice reporthttp://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdfThe DOJ also pointed out the racism in the Ferguson police departmentPolice violence against blacks is a huge problem, but michael browns shooting was justified.Tamir rice, eric garner, walter scott, akai gurley, samuel dubois, etc were killed unjustifiably and thus murdered imo. Brown was not murdered, he was killed because he charged the cop. An honest debate on this topic also includes acknowledging the times that police shoot people justifiably. Eg. Michael brownread the DOJ report. Wilson shot brown because brown was charging at him. Wilson claims that he chased brown for a while before brown turned and charged him. that is the critical piece.http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdfPage 16\" The locations of the shell casings are consistent with Wilson\u2019s account and the credible witness accounts. However, shell casings provide limited evidentiary value relative to the precise location of the shooter and bullet trajectory because they tend to bounce and roll unpredictably after being ejected from the firearm and before coming to rest. toward which Wilson had been shooting. As described below, crime scene detectives noted apparent blood in the roadway approximately 17 feet and 22 feet east of where Brown\u2019s body was found and east of the casings that were recovered, consistent with Brown moving toward Wilson before his death. There was no other blood found in the roadway, other than the pool of blood surrounding Brown\u2019s body. \"Read the legal analysis on page 78\"The evidence discussed above does not meet the standards for presentation of anindictment set forth in the USAM and in the governing federal law. The evidence is insufficient to establish probable cause or to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 and would not be likely to survive a defense motion for acquittal at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a). This is true for all six to eight shots that struck Brown. Witness accounts suggesting that Brown was standing still with his hands raised in an unambiguous signal of surrender when Wilson shot Brown are inconsistent with the physical evidence, are otherwise not credible because of internal inconsistencies, or are not credible because of inconsistencies with other credible evidence. In contrast, Wilson\u2019s account of Brown\u2019s actions, if true, would establish that the shootings were not objectively unreasonable under the relevant Constitutional standards governing an officer\u2019s use of deadly force. Multiple credible witnesses corroborate virtually every material aspect of Wilson\u2019s account and are consistent with the physical evidence. Even if the evidence established that Wilson\u2019s actions were unreasonable, the government would also have to prove that Wilson acted willfully, i.e. that he acted with a specific intent to violate the law. As discussed above, Wilson\u2019s stated intent for shooting Brown was in response to a perceived deadly threat. The only possible basis for prosecuting Wilson under Section 242 would therefore be if the government could prove that his account is not true \u2013 i.e., that Brown never punched and grabbed Wilson at the SUV, never struggled with Wilson over the gun, and thereafter clearly surrendered in a way that no reasonable officer could have failed to perceive. Not only do eyewitnesses and physical evidence corroborate Wilson\u2019s account, but there is no credible evidence to disprove Wilson\u2019s perception that Brown posed a threat to Wilson as Brown advanced toward him. Accordingly, seeking his indictment is not permitted by Department of Justice policy or the governing law.\"Page 83\"Brown\u2019s blood in the roadway demonstratesthat Brown came forward at least 21.6 feet from the time he turned around toward Wilson. Other aspects of the accounts of Witness 101 and Witness 127 would render them not credible in a prosecution of Wilson, namely their accounts of what happened at the SUV. Both claim that Wilson fired the first shot out the SUV window, Witness 101 claims that the shot hit Brown at close range in the torso, and both claim that Brown did not reach inside the vehicle. These claims are irreconcilable with the bullet in the SUV door, the close-range wound to Brown\u2019s hand, Brown\u2019s DNA inside Wilson\u2019s car and on his gun, and the injuries to Wilson\u2019s face.Other witnesses who have suggested that Brown was shot with his hands up in surrender have either recanted their statements, such as Witnesses 119 and 125, provided inconsistent statements, such as Witness 124, or have provided accounts that are verifiably untrue, such as Witnesses 121, 139, and 132. Witness 122 recanted significant portions of his statement by acknowledging that he was not in a position to see what either Brown or Wilson were doing, and who falsely insisted that three police officers pursued Brown and that the shooter was heavy set (in contrast to the slimly-built Wilson). Similar to Witness 128, Witness 122 told Brown\u2019s family that Brown had been shot execution-style. Witness 120 initially told law enforcement that he saw Brown shot at point-blank range as he was on his knees with his hands up. Similar to Witness 138, Witness 120 subsequently acknowledged that he did not see Brown get shot but \u201cassumed\u201d he had been executed while on his knees with his hands up based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d and what others \u201cin the community told [him.]\u201d There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence. For example, some witnesses say that Wilson only fired his weapon out of the SUV, (e.g. Witnesses 128, 101, and 127) or that Wilson stood next to the SUV and killed Brown right there (e.g. Witnesses 139, 132, 120). Some witnesses insist that Wilson shot Brown in the back as he lay on the ground. (e.g. Witnesses 128 and 139). Some witnesses say that Wilson shot Brown and he went to the ground immediately upon turning to face Wilson. (e.g. Witnesses 138, 101, 118, and 127). Some say Wilson went to the ground with his hands raised at right angles. (e.g. Witnesses 138, 118, and 121). Again, all of these statements are contradicted by the physical and forensic evidence, which also undermines the credibility of their accounts of other aspects of the incident, including their assertion that Brown had his hands up in a surrender position when Wilson shot him.  \"Unless you are going to argue the ultimate policing authority in america, under the control of eric holder and obama are lying to protect a police officer in a backwater little town, You have to accept that the DOJ report is truthful as far as to what the evidence says happenedback of your claims with some facts, instead of just making assumptions kid. I know its difficult for someone like you but try to educate yourself on the specifics of a topic and bring facts to a conversation rather than embarrass yourself with your ignorance about an event you obviously have not even read up on.",

            "text": "+Tylr Exactly what statistics are being ignored? And if you're talking about some majority rule when it comes to social policies that isn't how America has ever worked. If this were a pure Democracy that would be the case but as a Democratic Republic it's made so the majority can't oppress the minority. As for the TPP the fact it's a big trade deal isn't the problem. It's all the horrible things hidden within it that even the politicians signing off on it aren't told about (more than likely to cover their ass).In the case of Bernie and Rand unfortunately I doubt either of them will be the primary candidates unless there's some sort of revolution. CNN didn't even try to hide its corruption when they tried to say Hillary won the Democratic Debate despite the fact in CNN's own poll 80% said Bernie won the debate and then they deleted their poll before claiming Hillary won and they've been deleting all comments on their website calling them out on their bullshit ever since. It's more likely that we're going to end up with a Hillary vs Trump and most likely Hillary is going to win.",

I just left Europe I don't want to pay 60% tax.I actually favor Rand paul for the GOP right now.  He is the ONLY CANDIDATE on either side talking about auditing the FED reserve which is a big deal also.

Hillary and Obama are corporate whores just like the rest of the GOP (which is why I'm voting for Bernie).

Of course what some terrorists are doing in the name of Islam is terrible and somehow should be stopped, but America has worse problems on its soil and snow. If ISIS wanted to bomb somewhere in the US, there are already lots of people willing to do it for hire. 10 million is an amount of money where most people could be co-opted into doing almost anything, and people with weapons, religion though twisted, and lots of followers and a powerful propaganda arm on social media with the promise of 72 virgins and other rewards can attract plenty of people to do it.

I certainly wouldn't want to suggest that it is a great success or the future of the US energy industry, but it was important to diversify energy sources these last few years and it has played a key role in that.Third, the drones are morally awful, and they have been and will continue to be very controversial, but they are undeniably a step forward in modernising the army. You could question the introduction of machine guns, fighter jets and hand grenades with the same logic, but the families of US soldiers will be glad they exist, and its better to be the ones who have them.And finally, obamacare was nothing compared to what it could have been, but considering how hard it was to push through, it is a monumental achievement that wll improve tens of millions of people's lives. Its a good start.As I said before, far from perfect, but he has achieved a lot in phenomenally difficult times.",

Let's say out of a stroke of luck you live your whole life with Christian and no problem what so ever the one day you day u happen to met a muslim person he slaughter u same vice versa. You are far less likely to die in a plane then in a car, but people usually for the most part survive car crashes dispite being more frequent then plane crashes, however your survival rate for a plane crash is way lower than in car crashes see the down side.

            "text": "+MrZashOkay, well as a straight white male with liberal leanings, who has almost a decade on you, I can tell you that I HAVEN'T seen this aggressive \"Neo-Progressive mindset\". As a whole, I don't think it's that pervasive, do those people exist? Yes. Has it taken over the Left? It depends on where you're looking and how susceptible you are to believing a portion of a group of people colors the entire spectrum. I, however, don't feel like I'm targeted. I don't feel like I'm racist, or misogynistic or sexist.You might feel this way because you are looking for it maybe. I don't know what to say to you really, because this idea that the white man is being attacked is silly. I see a lot more white dudes complaining, but that doesn't mean their claims are true, it just means there are more platforms for dudes to complain on.All you can do to the people in those groups is roll your eyes and move on, because you're still acting in the EXACT same manner of the groups who claim you hate when you speak the way you do.As far as your Mohamed cartoon I guess it comes down to intent. Whether you have actually \"lost\" all your real life friends I have no way of knowing who they are and what they actually have said or done, but if you drew this cartoon to purposely piss people off, then wouldn't them being pissed off b the natural reaction? What were you looking for?Over empathizing can be bad, yes, but you also have to realize that the subjugation of an entire group of people has real life consequences for families that have nothing to do with radicals and violence. The angry language and hatred towards a singular group of people makes them a TARGET, and it's for that very reason that the left has upped the empathizing for innocent practitioners of Islam. Whether you believe they deserve that extra attention or not is irrelevant, as it is in direct result of our current world today and it comes not from the left but from the right. The Conservatives are the ones saying every single Muslim is our enemy and in response to that the Left has said No they aren't.It's two sides reacting to each other, not as you've said this idea that\"Political Correctness, this, Authoritarian attitude on the Left, is now more toxic than the Right\"I'm sorry you feel so frustrated and hopeless, but with what little experience I have over you, let me say that these things will pass and resorting to the ideas you're holding only exacerbates the current situation we're in.Even as other people become more reactionary and defensive we need others to remain as level headed and nuanced as possible. Voting for Trump won't \"stick it\" to anyone and in the end it won't make you feel any better or solve any problems.",

There is still violent sectarian conflict within the religion. Some Christian sects may have differences but none of them are violent. So I think there are some major differences from other religions. Hopefully in time this will change but you're right in saying education and better standards of living will help. I see this as a long process which might take generations since this has been going on for generations. In the meantime I think we need to keep our intervention at a minimum. Humanitarian aid and anything that helps bring them into the 21st century would be more productive than bombing the region when we don't even know what we're hitting most of the time. But I do agree with most of what you said. ",

This is without being bombed or occupied. This is a religion in need of a reformation. ;But I do agree with you that the only way to really combat this is with education. This is something that has to come from sensible Muslims. Unfortunately, in some Muslim countries they're afraid to speak out because it could get them killed. The US intervention in the middle east certainly hasn't helped matters. I agree that harsh rhetoric doesn't help and will alienate people we need to reach. Most Americans don't know any Muslims, I include myself, so they are easily seen as the \"other\". But we do have to realize that there are moderate Muslims that don't have these crazy beliefs and we shouldn't alienate them because they are in the best position to change the minds of fundamentalist Muslims. I hate all religions and think they cause dangerous beliefs. So my comments on Islam sound harsh and I was really disturbed by that poll. I'm also disturbed by Christians from American exporting their homophobia to Africa. We need more leaders to speak up about religious beliefs that cause draconian laws to be enacted.  ",

            "text": "+kristabella222 I am aware of those stats and that is why I attack the root of the problem and not the religion as a whole. Demonizing the people who go through the motions because of where they live instead of the ones who would lead the charge into barbarity is not the answer.   We have very questionable responses from within our own population on questions from the death penalty to torture to how the world was created.  The worst instincts you point out in the Islamic world were not that long ago business as usual here too.   Many of their worst ideas can be mitigated in the majority of a population with proper education even as you will not break them all or eliminate the existence of the ugliest elements.Dangerous brands of the abrahamic faiths thrive in best in chaos.   They fester everywhere but are most effective where people feel they have no options.  They grow best in places ignorance and a lack of education is the norm.   I see all versions of fundamentalism as branches of the same cancer.  Even elements of our modern \"reformed\" Christians seek to enact \"kills the gays laws\" in places like africa with money from the american faithful.   We need to work to marginalize all of these groups and fight our impulse to brand all faithful as the same version of failure.   Freedom and secular law was key to tearing away the power to control our lives from the Christians and it is the path we have to promote for the Muslim world as well.  This is not a quick process and expecting it will be is going to disappoint you.   Christianity did not have it's teeth torn out in a day and as per my example above they still have some ability to bite us even today.  That being said we have stepped out from under their thumb fully now and are never going to be pressed down like the Muslim world today is again.   We need to stop picking wars based on an economic status quo our leaders seek to preserve.  We need to promote administrations based on merit of their policy not what they give us.  We need to change our rhetoric and actions to take away the power of groups like ISIS to successfully paint us as the enemy of all Muslims.  We can only do so much, what we really need to do is foster an environment to let those already working for change in those communities to get a foothold because that is where the solution really lies.

We have a hard time dealing with extremely fundamentalist Christians who don't want to accept that our laws don't come from the bible and Muslim fundamentalists have ideas that are a bit more troublesome. The pew research poll was incredibly disturbing. You're probably aware that it showed that in many Muslim countries a large percentage of people believed horribly draconian things like cutting the hands off thieves, killing apostates, stoning homosexuals, etc. How do we reach people that think it's normal to stone someone to death for adultery? I know all Muslims aren't like this and I think that the moderate Muslims need to work to reform the faith. In the past I think our actions in the Middle east have helped radicalize a lot of Muslims and I know we have to be careful to not add to the problem. ",

Edward Garner, et al. if the subject running away poses a threat \"to others\" IE: he's a violent felon escaping arrest and poses a threat to public safety, the officer *IS*  authorized to use deadly force.Since that is NOT the case here, it's ENTIRELY relevant to the case at hand, specifically, in that the shoot was *unjustified*!ffs people.  Try thinking.  It's fundamental.",

Clearly yes. But does this give Netanyahu the right to butcher history???This is nothing more than another transparent attempt to further demonize the Palestinians. Only idiots gobble it up without question.

They want to undermine Obama and oppose every single thing he tries to do. They said as much when he first took office. The Republicans don't want him to have any legacy at all. At the same time this is an opportunity to make their donors, the defense contractors, a lot of money. They scare everybody into thinking we need more military spending maybe even a war. They are so transparent. It astounds me that anyone actually believes they really did this because they're honestly afraid Obama will do a weak deal and Iran will have nukes.",

What I am saying is, focusing on THAT bad argument as a straw man, instead of looking at the actual question of \"is Clinton objectively a far more amoral person, to the extent where his misdeeds cannot be compared to Trumps?\"  In terms of hypocrisy, that's what's really important.  This pastor made a lousy argument, so what.  It doesn't mean his conclusion is wrong.  This is a straw man, AND a false equivalency that Cenk is making, and you are defending.  It is illogical, and intellectually dishonest.I can believe 100% of the accusations against Trump, AND believe 10% of the accusations against Clinton, and Clinton would STILL be the objective scum bag.  The accusations against Clinton are far more numerous, and heinous.  Where there is smoke, there is fire - and when it comes to Clinton, smoke levels exceed those found at Snoop Doggs pad on 4/20.",

Also, some of the things Trump has been accused of is also clearly bullshit. What they are actually guilty of is mostly guess work at this time as neither has been convicted. The difference seems to be what you're willing to overlook, and the argument presented here boils down to \"We can excuse Trump because he wasn't in public office\" and that's something I can't support. Now if you wish to conclude that there's no evidence that Trump's done anything wrong then that's a different argument then what was presented here and I don't take exception to that.What it boils down to is I believe some of the things I've heard about Trump, but you clearly don't, but that has nothing to do with what I took exception to in this video.",

There are rape allegations, unwanted touching, harassment, all sorts of things like that leveled against Trump as well, I'm not going to claim that any of them would hold up in court but that would only make him even with Clinton.In the end both are innocent in the eyes of the law, but both have many allegations leveled at them.

There is also evidence that they have colluded with the manufacturers of the voting machines and tabulators in order to make them always flip a certain percentage of votes to Republican, which is why exit polling is always WAAAAY off in the US when exit polls are basically never off in other countries.",

I was talking about reality, you know, that thing that libertarians can't understand. I'd like to see evidence that governments create monopolies. Oh what, there isn't any.2) Movies are worse nowadays in every conceivable way.Why are the most socialist governments the most moral towards consumers & workers than the more libertarian countries then?3) How do libertarians stop child labour? If Corporations can be policed in that way, where do you draw the line?5) Corporations actively create poverty & milk the desperate individuals it affects dry. Payday loan firms have recently had to be regulated because of the massive degrees of usury they have incurred.A) Because they are voluntary if the population isn't informed of every issue they won't know how much of their budget should go to what charity, that would be a full-time job that the government takes care of for you.B) Charities have their 15 mins of fame, after that, nobody cares.C) If there's a corporate monetary benefit to be made from keeping them dependant, guess what happens in libertarian utopia.6) The only relevant role the Nazis played where in their evil, all their evil was via right-wing ideology & policy.",

It has to do more with attitude and poor choices. you are only focused on the few that can go to school, that are able to compete with other learned people. I went to a minority school, I knew that most of the students weren't going try to go to college. want to know why? because they copied off me for years.I know Most muslims buy into the propaganda. They don't even read their own holy book. well not their fault entirely most can't read.So they go off by what other people say.They would rather join the extremists.Which makes it understandable why they get bombed.No, I know there are different denominations. the funny part is many Muslims accuse other Muslims of not being true Muslims for it.Many ignore Muhammad's example, many add new prophets, many reject Muhammad's wives, Many interpret the Quran as law, Many interpret Jihad as a must, Many only follow the Peaceful parts, Many Don't take the Quran as law.There are tons of different Muslims but we are not worried about the peaceful ones.the dangerous ones, the brainwashed ones, the ones that force their religion on others, the ones that think their religion allows them to do whatever they want, the ones that think they can kill you because their beliefs tell them. these are the ones we don't want.No there are 4 types of Muslims.SecularFundamentalistIslamistJihadist.the only acceptable one is the secular Muslim. They respect others, they don't force their beliefs on others, they respect the laws on foreign lands, they want to assimilate to new cultures, they want to be part of a new culture.",

To say that things that undermine our democracy have NOTHING to do about a discussion about whether or not our democracy is fair is idiotic.First you mistake the word PROTECT for PRACTICE, now you can't even respond to direct contradictions to your claims.

Notice how you had absolutely nothing to say about voter suppression, campaign finance corruption or the fact that the politician with the most money almost always wins. \"Democracy\". If you're so ignorant that you think any random 35 year old natural born citizen has a legitimate shot at being president, you're completely out of touch with history. History that has proven time and time again that only a SPECIFIC range of individuals are ACTUALLY viable candidates.Yes, it does. I brought up the voter suppression, primary nonsense and the electoral college to counter your naive argument about our democracy being fair in any shape or form. There are systems in place from the bottom straight to the top of the food chain that limit the impact of YOUR vote to instead favor that of a tiny minority of people. That's the ANTITHESIS of democracy and borderline oligarchy. If you don't think protesting corrupt campaign contributions to DEMOCRATICALLY elected candidates has nothing to do with democracy itself, you're just not paying attention.

Obama accused Bush Jr. of running up $5 trillion on the national debt yet Obama has already ran up $8 trillion and his second term isn't even over.  The main reason for that is that Obama has yet to sign an annual spending bill since the Republicans took the majority in Congress.  Bush Jr. signed the budget bills even when the Democrats took power in congress. So the Democrats signed off on some of that debt under Bush and Obama.",

            "text": "+AndTheCorrectAnswerIs\"Owning\" is a loose term.  He often just licenses his name out, especially to developers.  It is called branding.  As stated from a Washington Post article:\"Trump has a kind of Midas touch: Many of the businesses he comes in contact with end up with his last name on them, often in large, gilded capital letters. Of the 515 companies that Trump has a part in running, 268 bear his last name, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. Yet not all of the buildings emblazoned with Trump's last name are owned by him; for many properties, he merely licenses his name to other developers.D\u2019Antonio says the strategy of branding and franchising is unusual for a businessperson, and more reminiscent of a professional athlete. \u201cDonald is brilliant about turning himself into a walking brand, and he seized that opportunity pretty early,\u201d he says.Trump\u2019s penchant for deploying his name has been a successful marketing strategy, but it also appears to satisfy a deeper desire for fame and accomplishment.In addition to the Trump hotels and casinos, there are Trump-branded steaks (developed for the Sharper Image catalogue, but still served in Trump hotel restaurants), a Trump board game, the now-defunct Trump magazine and Trump Airlines, and a line of shirts and ties called the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection. Trump has put his name on water, Israeli energy drinks, cologne, Virginian wine, vodka, furniture \u2013 \u201calmost anything that might be sold as high quality, high cost, and high-class,\u201d D'Antonio writes.\"And regarding his worth, also just as many articles have noted that he most likely is worth far less than the $10 billion that he claims.",

A common practice at the time (it was easier to raise capital for risky ventures thru junk bonds than thru bank financing). The recession in the early 1990's caused almost half of the casinos in Atlantic City to close their doors. Despite this, Trump managed to sell the Taj for $890 million in 1996. As far as what Trump manages goes, he has companies around the world and owns and operates golf courses, hotels, wineries, office buildings, and other real estate ventures. The Trump Organization currently employs 22,450 people. Trump isn't out there \"just selling his name\". I don't know where people would get this idea.",

Let private only take care of lower end premium care and plastic surgery. As in, instead of waiting a month for a none emergency operation (knee surgery and so on), people with money would still be able to skip the line by using private. Freeing up slots for the less well off as well.And instead of every Citizen buying medicines, the whole US Government is the single buyer. It would drastically cut military cost (apart from some key aspects like PTSD or military oriented limbs replacement meant to get the person back into duty and so on), while also reducing the cost of medicine for the whole US nation.You think, eg, Pfizer would risk losing access to a 350 million people marked by over charging? Or worse, risk losing access to US funded research because they became blacklisted after trying to black mail the US Government into paying an unreasonable amount for X new cancer treatment or whatever.",

My point was that male circumcision in the 1st world is the only kind where there's some room for discussion, with the other kinds being unacceptable.I mean, yeah, as a male you can always be circumcised later as a surgical outpatient procedure, but it's one of those things where you'd say to yourself 'I'd rather this had already done when I was a baby and I didn't remember it'.I mean, I've already been circumcised, so for me it's a done deal, it was done when I was a baby, and I'm fine about it.  I mean, it's not like I have days where I look at my junk, and wonder what could've been if I had a foreskin, to be honest about it. ",

            "text": "+LabTech I like the way you categorized it into four different points. On whole, I'd agree. Though for the last part, my opinion would be that unless there is a major health detriment for not being circumcised, it shouldn't be done until one decides as an adult (in a first world, of course). If I may use vaccines as an analogy, one reason it's done on children is because they could infect those who cannot get vaccines (immune deficient, infants, etc). Consent can take a backseat when lives are at risk; to a certain extent. If all circumcision offers is a minor health benefit that could equally be given by condoms, it isn't necessary to perform on infants.",

            "text": "+CyanCyborg Well, here we have to get into the nuance of the situation.The nuance is that circumcision can be divided into a couple different sets here, between male and female, and 1st world and 3rd world variants.Obviously, the 3rd world variants are right out, as they're barbaric practices done in typically unsanitary fashion by tribal elders, which usually lead to health complications, and are done for no other reason than that's the way it's always been done, and doubly so for girls, as the circumcision is done exclusively to deny female sexual gratification, and enhance it for male gratification.In the 1st world, female circumcision isn't done, unless it's in isolated pockets where 3rd world traditions are still kept, away from the prying eyes of the authorities.  Male circumcision in the 1st world, however, has some credence, in that it's almost exclusively done in a hospital by medical professionals using anesthetic and antiseptic procedures.  There's some evidence to support the notion that removing the foreskin has some health benefits, but there's some evidence to support that removing the foreskin is unnecessary, so there's some room for debate with that variant.All that having been said, on the whole I'm against the notion of genital mutilation.  I'd probably need to read up on the health benefits of male circumcision before I had a definitive position on it.  If there are benefits, I'm inclined to have it done early, so that it's over with, and you have no memory.  If there aren't benefits, then it should be up to the male later in life, as with any other health choice.  Still, parents make plenty of choices for their children before they're old enough to make their own choices, and if they think it's in the child's best interests health-wise, then it should be their choice.

If Texas secedes, those people will suddenly lose that government assistance. If a bunch of people suddenly lose their source of food then they'll more than likely turn to crime.Then there's the fact America would more than likely put a trade embargo on Texas similar to the one we used to have on Cuba and Texas would lose all military weaponry from the US government so it would suddenly become a pretty vulnerable target to invaders.",

You need to bring in new young voters or your party becomes what the Republican party is today & starts to implode & die as it collapses in on itself, & if you muddy the waters between Republican & Democrat by electing Hillary Clinton you will turn off soo many new & old voters alike to even get engaged, we will lose some of the Democrats largest & most important demographics ultimately ending the Democrats chances of ever being elected again in the future.People are sick of the lesser of two evils candidate being good enough...",

Hillary Clinton ran an ad where she edited his speech, and added text to change \"their\" to \"they're\" - which changes the meaning completely.  If you don't believe me, I urge you to look into it for yourself.  The original context of the speech is\"They're sending their criminals and rapists\"it was edited and presented as\"They're criminals and rapists\"If you look into it, you will discover Trump didn't say all Mexicans are criminals and rapists.  That would be ludicrous - just insane.  Trump doesn't believe that, most of his supporters don't believe that, I certainly don't believe that.  There is a lot of misinformation out there, and it's feeding into the hatred and violence.  I will concede Trump can speak with a bit more tact and sensitivity.Are criminals and rapists flowing through the border though?  Yes, absolutely.  There are gangs in CA comprised entirely of illegals immigrants.  It seems we agree on securing the border though, so I don't need to pontificate there.If you really do care about the border - Trump is the only candidate who'll deliver.",

Cosby, on the other hand.....In this scenario, Trump is Kobe, and Bill Clinton is Cosby.Regardless, it doesn't really change the fact that Trump's policies are the best for America and Americans - so he's getting my vote.  I'm curious, why do you REALLY dislike Trump?  It's not about those empty rape accusations, you have your own agenda, so what is it?  How does he threaten you personally, Senorita Santos?",

You also posted a site that has horrible articles like \"Why don't we just pay men less than women?\". What a hypocrite. And yes that site has tons of bias. And once again, unarmed =/= innocent. Dylan Noble was unarmed, Trayvon Martin was unarmed, Mike Brown was unarmed... All of these people were threats. I know nothing about that case but it sounds like an accident. Accidents happen. Tons of cops die in car crashes. You proved nothing and TYT is still misleading and defended a thug from the Bloods that had golden teeth, an illegal gun and tried to kill cops... They also claimed that they couldn't know if Alton Sterling had a gun yet they showed the video where we can see that he has a gun, but they edited that part out.",

There are also swinger groups in Iran and the \"Abstinence only\" states are the ones with the highest teen pregnancy. However if someone already has cheated knowing that their job is threatened in addition to their marriage incentivises them to go along with the blackmail rather than report it and get in trouble. ",

I say, not pushing any morality, jealousy will always be there in case of relationships and will always have potential security risks. Decriminalizing military adultery will encourage the behavior with potentially more blackmail possibilities, but will make it only marginally less susceptible to blackmail. Or perhaps what you are suggesting, is that people will value their military job more than their marriage. A rather sad commentary on marriage, but if true, you may have a point. Imagine the military effectiveness of a group of wives swapping adulterous killing machine......",

It's not liberals who think America isn't great, it's conservatives and Republicans who do because it's not as racist, sexist, bigoted, and biased as you'd like it to be. I think America is great and that's why I feel free to criticize America for the things that aren't great. America has Millions upon millions of acres in room for improvement. You claim I have some affiliation with Isis or some nonsense but most conservatives would happily inflict biblical law which is just your version of sharia law in America. It's the conservatives who need to go live in Iraq, North Korea or Iran so they can finally understand that their version of America is so similar to Iran North Korea and Iraq that it's damn near ironic. You need to know that many of your fellow Americans don't see the difference between American conservatism and religious fascism elsewhere in the world.",

This could conceivably happen to the Republican party I think. The Tea Party was almost a viable exception. The Green Party might someday gain more support, especially if the Republicans move far enough to the right and the Democratic party becomes the Center Right party. The original parties were the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. For a short time there was a Whig and Democratic party. But since then, although there have been many 3rd, 4th and 5th parties, the Republican and Democratic parties have dominated.But for the most part, as you say, independent or third-party candidates don't stand a strong chance of winning more than a few percent of votes. Our system is winner-take-all which makes the winning party and candidate look more popular than they or their policies are.I think Trump is in it for the publicity. He may be a great salesman, but he is a terrible leader.Anyway, it is possible that we may be coming to a time of transition. I think the Republican party is disintegrating. But I'm not confident of any outcome.",

For every economist who says that when you do A, B will happen, you can find one who will say C, or D, or E will happen.Economists can't even agree on what caused certain events in the past. There is a lot of speculation and guess-work involved, and on top of that, it's very often agenda-driven.So, yeah, you might be right, but you might also be wrong.

What will happen is that the rich will shift their money and bussiness abroad to get away from those taxes. I'm from the netherlands and the poor here pay a 37% income tax. The effective tax rate for a average dutchman is 72% and we run a budget with a deficit. I saw the deficit in america and its much higher then here. How on earth can his tax plan balance the budget provide \"free\" healthcare, free college and invest in infrastructure without blowing a massive hole in the budget? Its simply not possible. This democratic socialism thing can only be done in the us on a state level and even then i doubt that americans will like it if their income taxes have risen to half their income to pay for all of the nonsense he is proposing.",

Democrats are supporting her because of her name recognition.  But she's extremely unpopular outside of the democratic base and even staunch democrats tend to not trust her.  A lot of people really dislike her and will not vote for her no matter what.  If she wins, voter turnout will be extremely low, meaning the democrats will also lose seats in the house and the senate.Mark my words.  If Hillary Clinton wins the democratic primary, Trump is the odds on favorite to win the White House and republicans are likely to gain a supermajority in the Senate as well.Hillary Clinton is going to be a disaster for this country, via Donald Trump.",

Churchill had Indian crops and supplies pillaged to feed the troops, which led to over 3 million Indians starving to death. This doesn't even count the millions of Indians who were starved, by the British, due to the Brits destroying food crops in order to plant opium fields, which were profitable to themWhat many people question is the whole gas chambers claim, since there has been scientific inquiries into this which the European government has shut down.",

That you imagine this narrative validates you is a fail for the reasons I have already pointed out.  Even if I did dig up the quotes they would not validate my spin for the same reason your quotes do not back your narrative. Policy and actions are what we should be discussing because that speaks to what he actually stands for and out of context quotes no matter what they are is not the proof you pretend it is.

For example (apologies if this is offensive) but there's an argument to whether or not Michael Hastings death was caused by someone else taking control of his vehicle & crashing it, I don't know if in Michael Hastings case that's true or not, but after that story came out evidence came to light that it is quite easy to take control of today's more primitive cars. So if they can already do it now with our current automobiles, we mine as well get a smarter driverless version. Do you not agree?",

If it said otherwise, they would not.Plus if you think you're a smart libertarian, you're screwed, according to the same source: http://reason.com/archives/2012/12/04/often-wrong-never-in-doubtThere also is a lot of causation without correlation going on. Smart people want lower taxes because they're generally richer, for example.There is also no definite way to measure intelligence. Whereas I'm extremely knowledgeable on economics, I know virtually nothing about art. Is the polar opposite of me smarter, or dumber?Finally, just because people with higher IQs may think a certain way doesn't mean they're right. A group of extremely intelligent, well rounded theologians may believe that vaccines are a negative, while doctors who may not be as well rounded will say the opposite. This does not make the theologians right.I don't mean to discourage you with all this information, I'm just trying to show you that, if anything, it's probably a better idea to expand your ideas beyond objectivity where only subjectivity exists.",

We can't reach others officially yet and technology can only do so much for us. And it'd take somewhere around 100,000 years (estimated) to terraform Mars to a breathable atmosphere. Do you understand that? Our planet is precious. If we destroy it...then that's it. We destroyed ourselves.2. Nuclear war. I don't need to say anything else.",

Do you know why the Landrum-Griffin Act was made? in the 1950s the Teamsters Union ran a money laundering scheme with the American mafia. That was in this country. Also youre entire argument for explaining you shouldn't judge unions by a few bad apples can be applied to corporations as well. There are over 6 million corporations in this country and all of them get judged by the actions of less than 2,000. You are condemning an entire type of business simply for the actions of the .03% corporations. So if youre going to use that argument, don't throw corporations under the bus.",

            "text": "+jetsfan jetsfa Because when I want to be objective I'll go to PETA for my facts *rolls eyes*The TRUTH of the matter is is that the WAY in which we produce and manufacture our beef and the artificial means by which we INFLATE our meat products leads to rising level in C02 emissions but eating meat, producing it just by itself is NOT a significant amount.In fact any REAL Scientific Journal:http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greenhouse-hamburger/Will tell you that we believe it's anywhere from 22 to 36 based on HOW we produce it.Yes, of course we need to reduce our consumption overall(fatass americans yada yada yada) but there is just as much evidence to point to the opposite argument.OVER consumption is the problem. Since Meat production is one of the largest productions of course it's going to be a significant factor.https://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/files/eatgreenfs_feb2010.pdfSo the KEY isn't to stop eating meat, it's to eat meat or beef that is produced without pesticides and other un-natural methods that themselves are the significant source of it and reduce it over all. NOT having to go vegan. That's just--idiotic.So no. No apology for you.Sorry dude I've actually done my research on this and it's ALREADY something I do. Shop and eat locally. Buy from my local farmers' market and if I am going to go out and eat I and the rest of my family investigate where the restaurant(fast food as well) gets their meat and vegetables.And yes, it applies to veggies as well. Hippie says what?#feelthebern",

            "text": "+Steven Clark 4. Ultimately what holds all businesses in a libertarian society accountable are three things: 1. The law. 2. the consumer and 3. the market itself. There are still laws in place for a libertarian society, you cant commit fraud, or murder or screw over people for no reason. What those laws are depends on the judicial system you create. Largely who enforces those laws are other private organizations, other businesses and consumers who don't want to be cheated. Also in a libertarian society, the consumer has significantly more market power. The consumer's choice influences the demand for a product and therefore the price of most goods as well. If the majority of people are not willing to buy cars for $50,000, the company must make changes to fit the demand. There is no other force in place to establish subsidies for a company as a cushion. Lastly the market itself makes corrections when something is wrong. if you make a poor decision there is no safeguard to keep you steady. Your stock falls and your investors want their money. If you overvalue your company through fraud the market corrects your mistake and devalues your company below what you are worth. By doing so investors pull out and your company falls to the ground.",

            "text": "+Steven Clark 1. Its not a guarantee, but if there is a demand by the people that these individuals should be cared for then a new business will always take the place of another as long as there is a demand. To suggest otherwise is saying that people will no longer care for the poor or disabled. if that's truly the case, then the system hasn't failed- humanity has failed.2. You have a very thick set of blinders. Yes organizations like SNAP and WIC help people, but do you know why LBJ created SNAP in the first place? It was originally conceived to eradicate hunger. A very tough task. However what is even more interesting in my opinion is how the hunger rate has actually been increasing since the 1970s despite the increase funding given to SNAP. SNAP has failed for 46 years to decrease the rate below 1970 stats. If you continue to throw $90 billion into a program that has failed to decrease rates for 46 years, that's the definition of insanity. Its amazing to me how you think these government programs are so much better yet, private organizations exhibit much higher growth rates, generating an increased rate in aid than gov programs. I'm baffled that you actually believe the government is doing a great job taking care of you.3. You discuss how libertarians value profit over ethics, which is true. However the great reality is in any market, money is everything. You can incentivise businesses to do the ethical thing through money. Now before you say this is a bribe, it works a bit differently. Lets look at FAI for example (back to #2, FAI is a non-profit private organization). Now of course FAI can ask for charity from companies to do the right thing. Or they can tell grocery companies, that if you supply food banks with your products the thousands of people who go to food banks will be eating your products for years. Therefore when they get back on their feet they are more likely to buy from your stores. Now instead of just giving charity, these grocery companies are providing a long term investment to help themselves. FAI is also satisfied because they are given more donations than if they simply begged. This is just basic incentivising in business. It can be done both positive (as seen in example) or negatively (like suggesting if a business makes a bad decision than can be liable to massive costs- so they don't make that decision).",

That's the problem with relying entirely on private charity as a social safety net, the net might be there one day, the next it might not. And then you have all the selfish bastards who won't donate to charity living off the resources everyone else helped to create. In human society, you shouldn't be given the option to not care about the poor and disenfranchised. That's not an attitude we want to cultivate because it would lead to the fall of our civilization. You say this is unlikely yet people step over homeless in the streets everyday and many never donate to charity. People still go hungry in America and if it weren't for welfare, WIC, SNAP, and other programs, many more would as well. Also private charities are harder to hold accountable and more easily corrupted, especially in a libertarian society that values profit above ethics. A government can at least provide oversight and can be made accountable to the people.We as a people have agreed that we should pool some of our resources to help those that lose in the free market maintain a minimum standard of living. Those that are most able to pay should pitch in more since they have the most power and thus the most responsibility.",

I've been corrected by people who have statistic and facts. Not say that I'm convince but that there's a possibility. We have 2 of the most hated candidates in the two main parties. Many of their delegates and supporters are migrating from the parties (Something like 10-12% from each party that was what I remember, so there's like 20 to 24% floating there) and also some(some not all) Bernie supporters. I know that the chance is small, but I wouldn't use the word non viable as this election's situation is unique.",

Now you can call yourself what you like, but that is the point of view you are arguing for whether you like it or not. Quacks like a Duck, Walks like a Duck, I'm gonna call it a Duck.Let me just restate my core argument, to which you have provided NO counter.If the states compete without Federal regulation its a race to the bottom, because states NEED business, to provide jobs.Buying United States Senator cost 2-5 million dollars, typically, depending on how much he or she needs for his campaign.The campaign of a State senator is around 50 thousand. In other words buying a state government is FAR FAR cheaper for a corporation. Owning one state, means they can easily enact a complete removal of all regulation. End welfare and public pensions in favor of Tax cuts? No problem. Remove the minimum wage? Children working the mines? No problem.Your argument was, but people wouldn't want to live there then. Well, they don't have a choice, that is were the jobs are.And this pattern is mirrored in the 3rd world. which maintains their level of poverty because they all are forced to compete against each other on wages.",

If that is what their citizens want then fine, why should I tell them no? Same as in if a state wants low taxes. Why should citizens of another state complain?

States that have methods to improve will be hindered in doing so, thus the whole country is only as strong as its weakest link.\"Thestate that provides the lowest taxes, the least amount of labor, environmental and consumer protection wins, and presto, the US joins India, China and Bangladesh in being a third world country with an exploitation economy.\"There is a lot more that goes in an economy than taxes and regulations. Also no state will want that when the state next door to them is succeeding. People will just live in that state and let the other one suffer. We see that as is in the US with Detroit. Problem is that Detroit keeps getting bailed out by the fed with their welfare programs. \"Nope. Not large, not small, remove the scale completely. ANY GOVERNMENT can be bought.

One big difference I have noticed between those who lean politically right and those who lean politically left is that the former of the two tend to be more involved in the community and are more aware of what is going on. Not so much for those on the left. I see why the political left want a more centralized government because they think like you. But the reality is that at the local level there is far more accountability, especially if you get involved. I personally met both candidates for mayor in my city. I see how my tax dollars are spent. If I don't like it I can call them out, vote them out, or move. You can't do that at the federal level. \"Scandinaviannations are the least corrupt in the world, while having the most amount of State v Capital power, while nations with almost non-existent government, like Somalia are the most corrupt on earth.\"And Scandinavian nations are smaller than a lot of our states. \"But it doesn't go the other way either, Soviet Union had MASSIVE corruption, asdid the Former Jugoslavia, and they had almost full state control, while nations like Switzerland, with very little state control also has very little corruption.\"And the Soviet Union has a massive population.",

Thus you should be abled to downsize the military to the point where it's budget only needs to be half as large as it currently is and still not run any security risks.",

A complete and total shutdown of Muslim immigration is harsh but if you look at what is going on in Europe right now, more specifically England, Germany, France, Belgium and Sweden you need to be a total ostrich to not recognise that allowing mass-immigration of Muslims and Africans into your country means you're putting your own people in danger. In Germany alone there are believed to be 10.000's of ISIS sympathists and jihadists but the government does not know who they are so they can't do anything about it. The statement 'we should not let any more Muslims in because we don't  know who we are bringing in' is actually a legitimate one. You can see in Europe what happens if you do.",

            "text": "/watch?v=D_kIwGFQDhoFrom O'Reilly's book, Killing Kennedy: \u201cIn March 1977 a young television reporter at WFAA in Dallas began looking into the Kennedy assassination. As part of his reporting he sought an interview with the shadowy Russian college professor who had befriended the Oswalds upon their arrival in Dallas in 1962.  The reporter traced de Mohrenschildt to Palm Beach, Florida and travelled there to confront him. At the time de Mohrenschildt had been called to testify before a congressional committee looking into the events of November 1963. As the reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt\u2019s daughter\u2019s home, he heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the Russian, assuring that his relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald would never be fully understood.  By the way, that reporter\u2019s name is Bill O\u2019Reilly.\u201dThis isn't deceptive information like \"I think that Obama turned his back on the bankers ultimately because his perspective is from someone who has always had a chip on his shoulder, even back to the Community Organizer days, against rich Jews.\"  Such an argument would be thoroughly counter-factual and absurd, but it is still just an opinion.  This isn't just sloppy reporting, like what Dan Rather was fired for.  This is an absolute, outright, knowing lie.  O'Reilly has less credibility than ANY of the people you are talking about.",

You do know that O'Reilly claimed to be at the doorstep of a Kennedy Assassination enthusiast in Florida when he heard the fatal suicide gunshot from behind the door.  You also do know that tape has surfaced with O'Reilly getting word of the man's suicide from a reporter and then O'Reilly saying that he would fly into Florida the next day.  Right?  Or was the tape doctored by President Logan and Auric Goldfinger?",

Interviews are proof and the fact that he never said anything about newspapers lying about what he said is proof too. He contradicted his paper because he did more research. Do you really think he sat there waiting 5 years doing absolutely no research?There's entire blogs dedicated to laugh at all of these climate change predictions from multiple \"scientists\". Trust me, them being proved wrong hasn't changed anything since the left keeps brainwashing people into believing the end of the world is coming soon if we don't vote democrat.And no, he is THE climate scientist. He started all of this crap. he is the most important and famous one.Yeah there's tons of people working on this and tons of data yet when I post videos of actual climate scientists and experts talking about it you dismiss it as right wing propaganda. Looks like anything you don't believe or disagree with is propaganda full of lies.Organizations full of people that agree with climate change that are respected only by the left.If you watched the PragerU you wouldn't say those thing since one of the videos was made by an actual climate scientist informing on the different groups involved on climate change:/watch?v=OwqIy8Ikv-cAnd you seem to fail to understand what Prager's youtube channel is all about. The people that make the videos don't actually work there and they disagree with each other in multiple topics. The people featured in these videos are experts that decided to make a video about a topic to inform people. Just because some guy defended Wall Street doesn't mean the climate scientist of the video I posted agrees with it. I don't trust the channel I trust the experts on it. You know, people that have been doing this for like 30 years. I'm pretty sure they know more than Cenk does.",

            "text": "+scotaloo7 7g7I say he didn't say these things, because there is no convincing proof, and he had to be insane to say them. He would have contradicted his own scientific paper. A sane person only does that is he got contradicting evidence since then. But the scientific consensus hasn't changed much, so that's not the case. I found no proof of him losing his mind, so that's out too. He may have lied to further his agenda, and that has a little more possibility, but a that big lie is very risky. It can destroy his scientific carrier, and and in the long term, when it's inevitably disproved it hurts his case too. So without rock solid evidence I have no reason to believe. Also I know that newspapers has their own political agenda, and the often just make up things to improve their ratings.Again, it's not possible to prove something didn't happen. I don't have an audio recording of his entire life. On the other hand, it's very possible to prove he said those things, by finding a credible source. As I explained multiple times.There is no such thing as \"THE climate scientist\". Science doesn't work that way. Newspapers may call him that way, but that's just proves how they don't understand science.Also it can be interpreted as a historical thing, like him being one of the first who warned the public about the dangers of climate change. That doesn't mean he is the is the only source of infinite wisdom. It just means he was the first. but Thousands of others are working in this field, and a fuckton of more data has been collected since then.You apparently doesn't understand propaganda. I gave you an actual scientific paper. I can give you hundreds more if you like. Also there are big respectable organizations on \"my\" side, like every single one that has anything to do with climate science.On the other side are politicians and right wing news organizations. Dose are not exactly the most trustworthy kind of people. And of course behind them is the trillion dollar fossil fuel industry.Also, as I said PragerU is pure propaganda. It defends Wall Street too. Why do you trust a YouTube channel more than NASA, NOAA, and all climate scientists?Do you really think there is a global conspiracy there? With hundreds of thousands of people? And no single whistle blower?Look up the leaked e-mails from prominent climate scientists, and see if you find evidence. Climate change deniers already read them carefully, and found only two that seemed like maybe something, but turned out to bee nothing.",

You claimed he didn't do this. You made a claim, now prove it. And no, this isn't just a scientist. To the left he is THE climate scientist. You linked the guardian before.

Now stop calling people names and address their talking points. PragerU debunked all of your claims. Even the co-founder of Greenpeace has a video on PragerU debunking this.I could claim that all of what you believe is left wing propaganda and then dismiss everything based on that.

Or even just one of those 500,000 Iraqi children whose death(s) Madeline Albright so callously said \"was worth it\".  I never said the UK agent wasn't murdered... are we going to pretend that espionage is not a high-stakes game here?  As opposed to being an innocent child killed by a drone strike!!!  Wow... just, wow!!Putin is only responding when provoked.  Ukraine, Georgia... he did not initiate the events that started these.  He did take matters into his own hands, because believe it or not other nations do have their own security interests.  You think Putin is overreaching with Crimea... the rest of the world thinks post-9/11 US neocon foreign policy is overreaching.Which one has a better case??  I think we know that is why CNN moderates their comments and they are scrambling to explain events on the ground.   It doesn't take a Russian to see that the US is consolidating a global empire has grown to proportions that Nazi Germany could have only dreamed of.The problem is.... ordinary Middle Class, or even rich Americans do not benefit from all the wars they pay the bill for.  The ultra-rich war profiteers benefit; Joe Biden's son benefits (although his job does not look to be safe, Poroshenko is in deep doo-doo).I speak for the everyman, not for the vested interests expanding a corporate/financial empire across the world.  Americans are tired of this and the Feds know it... that is why the propaganda has kicked into high gear.",

            "text": "+dangerouslytalented And killing him would only strengthen his message.  You do know why politicians avoid making martyrs out of people at all costs, right??  The Russian opposition itself did not want to see its leader killed, but those who DO support \"*enter anti-Putin candidate*\" have a strong motive to make a martyr out of Nemtsov.  Why?  Because they don't care about the MAN as much as they care about the IDEA.  The \"idea\" being ABP = Anybody But Putin.  Killing the man helps the overall cause.Nemtsov was not doing a good enough job anyhow.  Putin has widespread support.  You think Russians are angry that he \"invaded\" Crimea?  By invade, what you are essentially saying is:Putin stationed a bunch of Russian troops on the Crimean Peninsula -- a pro-Yanukovich region with a long-standing, key naval port in Sevastapol and a Russian speaking majority, as well as roughly half ethnic Russians -- as if this is such a scandal??  Not to mention, it was in the wake of a coup provoked by NATO involving Western money; and the first move Nuland's hand-picked \"Yats\" pulled was to attack the status of the Russian language.Crimeans welcomed Russian troops and shortly thereafter, officially rejoined Russian dominion.  And who could possibly argue that they are not better off than Kiev currently is for having done so??  Leave it alone, there are bigger problems in the world.  Seriously, the hypocrisy is mind-blowing!!That Hilary Clinton compared Putin's \"invasion of Crimea\" to the Anschluss really only makes me wonder about how warped the official record of world conflicts really is.  I can clearly see that Putin does not have a global empire the way the US does today, and yet they talk as if he is trying to take over the world.  Did he take out Gaddafi for wanting to trade his oil in gold dinars?  Did he kill Saddam Hussein once he was no longer useful against the Iranians??",

I'm just trying to tell people that undertaking a project of this type is complex and you are only successful if there is a political culture that is conducive to that.I come from a country, France, that has developed high speed trains in the 70s and they came online in 1981 I believe. Since them, the number of lines have multiplied, pretty much every single major city is somewhat connected to Paris, the only large metropolis in the country.The development of TGVs in France has been all but plain sailing. Delays, cost overruns, political en-wranglings, protesting ecologists and residents etc... And that's in a country where the central state has a lot of power compared to the US and at a time where most of the contractors were publicly owned corporations.I don't think TYT or people in the US in general understand that it is a difficult project to realise, even in the best of conditions and in countries that have a state thinking strategically (France, Germany etc...) and contractors that are natural government suppliers. The US has none of that!It's very unlikely there will ever be a Maglev in the US, at least not for decades (assuming the project proves successful elsewhere), California can't even build a traditional high speed rail and virtually no state has any experience in advance railways infrastructure.Undertaking large infrastructure project isn't just a matter of making a decision and voting a budget (which would be hard enough given the state of politics in America). That's only the very beginning of your troubles.",

You either agree with me that men sent to their deaths in defense of the lives of their wives and family are worse off than those wives and families, or you're an insane person who wishes death upon everyone you care about and life upon your enemies. Besides which, death is typically painful and terrifying itself, getting shot or stabbed in the gut means that you're going to bleed out over perhaps the course of hours on end, and for all that time you are fully aware that you are in the process of dying (y'know, until the pain and fear drives you mad). To say nothing of all those throughout history who, instead of being outright killed, were captured and tortured for information. You really think all that is less of a hardship than having to do the work that the man would otherwise be doing? I'm sure the man would rather have been doing that work, but he had to go fend off an invading army who would've most likely killed him anyway once they'd reached their home - and probably killed the family too!",

You're simply too intellectually dull to understand what I'm saying, so you continue to draw conclusions that don't necessarily correlate to what I've said. My argument doesn't rely on killing myself and/or anyone else, well, except for maybe counter-revolutionary fascists that just won't give up their greed. It relies on the correct political philosophy that includes the idea that peace can be achieved and the majority of suffering relieved. You don't achieve this by ignoring people's natural and unnatural privileges. You don't achieve it by ignoring the fact that there is pain in life and nothing in death. The fact there is nothing in death is more reason to live than to die. Life also includes pleasure, which is something one can aspire to even or especially when experiencing pain. ",

Thanks to energy, we have been able to master the climate. What you're suggesting, is going backwards. You'll have to provide sources. And if indeed they're so much cheaper and efficient, then you couldn't stop people from buying them. That's how markets work. The article is talking about windmills, because with solar you're limited to places with *year-round* sunlight. Germany gets 27% from all renewables. That's barely above a quarter. We have been subsidizing renewables for almost a decade, yet they make up negligible power production. Yes, the markets. *Again* if indeed they show promise like you claim, then they would be successful on their own.Lol, renewables are subsidized to the tune of $90 billion a year (most of which go bankrupt).

That's an incalculable cost.Manufacturers have moved away from the more poisonous (and more expensive) materials, into a significant number of safer and cheaper materials. Graphene, for example, is truly a material of the future - with both photovoltaic properties and the potential for use as a capacitor - and the college kid that discovered a relatively cheap and safe way to manufacture it was also the one to discover its photovoltaic properties. That's only one material, but it's far from the only one.The article delves straight into the space needed to provide energy for all these homes, ignoring completely that most of the space used is roofs, and discussing huge installations.Now - I never even suggested that you said that it wouldn't work for some situations. You didn't, as far as I recall - but you do seem to be behind on the reality of the possibilities. Germany is now getting considerably more power from solar than anything else, and it works fine - and many countries (including the US, though damn slowly) are moving that direction, embracing the future, even as there's a virtual explosion in the technology involved.Lastly, I have to ask - leave what alone? The market? If that's what you mean, I'm pretty tired of subsidizing poisonous industries of a century ago or worse, when we have developing technologies that show incredible promise, and they get less than 10% of the subsidies.",

The problem stems from your inability to stop participating in politics like it is a team sport. You treat valid criticisms of your criminal politicians as partisan attacks and you protect criminality so as not to give the \"other team\" leverage. The problem isn't money in politics, the two are inseparable. Money will always follow power. The problem is that the party drones refuse to hold their reps accountable. You all complain and complain then go and vote the same person back into office. Obama has been worse than Bush and a lot of Dems still pretend like he is on their side.",

Obama's and Hillary's tax plans are much better for small businesses than Trump's whose tax plan is a give away to himself and other millionaires. Yes, Trump is probably a millionaire and not a billionaire as he likes to brag. Even with his huge inheritance on top of loans and help from his father, he failed time and again. He's a boastful clown and con man who went bankrupt 6 times. Only a fool would want him to have control of our nation's economy. I'm aware of Hillary's flaws and her problematic ties to Wall St. but I'm also aware of Trump's incompetence and lack of the intellect necessary for a president.

Housing isn't a crisis in countries with ageing populations, if you cut immigration(again needed for growth so that johnny come lately can get rich), you will end up with more housing than you know what to do with in a few decades.Different story in the developing(a/k/a failed world), they are beyond fucked, especially when the consequences of climate change hit in earnest.",

Very Smart move she knew voters are more uninformed down here so just say Obama and she gets the vote. Media made sure that a lot of people didnt get to know who he is. The DNC had the debates at times when they knew no one would be watching. You do know that Time Warner Cable which owns CNN is Hillary 7th highest donor. So you know they were not going to be fair to Bernie. And What? Have you watched a debate? Have you been to his website? I know his policies inside and out he has had to explain everything over and over again. And it came down to judgement on the Iraq War same info Hillary got he was the only one that said we need to think of the consequences of going into war. And you did not answer my question about her taking money from every special interest from the NRA to Wall street to Private Prisons you name it she has taken there money while claiming to be against them. His foreign Policy is avoiding war and intervention at all cost. We are not the policeman of the world. And as far as her plan to pay back student loan it is exactly what Obama has in place now. Serious question tho how can you trust anything she is saying?",

Bernie has been in this race over a year....that's on Bernie if nobody knows who he is.His rallys are very simplistic. Just because they are long, it doesn't make them nuanced. He beats a dead horse and while I agree with him most of the time, he never answers the vital quesition. HOW?If you can link me how Bernie improves education at lower levels like K-12? Bernie only mentions college. There's more to our education system than just college. How is Clinton's plan the same thing as we have now? Here's her stance on college just in case you've haven't read it...https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/college/I see you also brought up foreign policy. What is Bernie's stance actually? Yes we all know he didn't vote for Iraq, but why doesn't he mention the several times he voted for regime change in Iraq in the late 90s?",

Notice how Obama isn't pictured playing basketball anymore, he's now criticized for playing Golf.When Obama came into office, they made all these claims that black people would also be moving into the *White* House and that Obama was gonna give reparations... Which he had to come out and say that he wasn't. It's annoying how people side track these facts and how Obama has been talked about in the context of race, since he announced he was running for president and even worse after he became president.",

I'm not the one claiming they're not valuable, the market is. That should be a simple distinction.Luxury and affordable are subjective terms. The most complex, pretty, luxurious, and decorated item is worthless if no one wants to spend any money to buy it off of you. You will burn wealth creating diamonds in the desert, when everyone just wants water. That burned wealth would have been better spent on desalinization or digging wells, just like the wealth burned on those cities would have been better spent on things people need right now.Why are your arguing against such a basic concept?China wanting 6%-7% growth is an example of the tragedy of Keynesianism. They think they can get growth by taking growth away from one sector of the economy and applying (or misapplying) it somewhere else, but all they can accomplish is the same growth at best, and destruction of wealth at best. And it's not just China, it's every country that uses Keynesian economics to guide its government, whether that's through taxing and spending on social programs, or borrowing and spending on infrastructure.But overall, as per the original point, that fucks with the meaning of the GDP. US economy has to collapse its $20 trillion debt before its true GDP emerges.Regarding businesses creating demand, best and classic example of that used in business schools is Apple and their iPhone. But it's not that the demand wasn't there, it was, just not realized. If that demand didn't exist, no one would have bought them.And, again, companies risking their own money, failing, and going away after swallowing the whole risk themselves is OKGovernments risking other people's money against their will, failing, and forcing other people to bail them out regardless is NOT OK.I'm sure you can recognize the obvious moral hazard problem. And that doesn't go away if you just limit it to a little bit of central planning a like in France or USA",

The apartments built are luxury condos and what people need is affordable housing.But really, it's not an affair of markets. China wants 6%-7% growth and will build just about anything to meet that self imposed target. Building empty cities may be a spectacular but it way well be the safest way of achieving that. I can think of a million ways the Chinese government could screw up with that money. Given the fact that the majority of Chinese citizens live in substandard housing, this appears less risky than what Mao did during the Great Leap forward.*\"I'm saying the trend was obviously not there, was miscalculated\"*I don't think you understand. China is not really a market economy. It's a planned economy, at least at the government level. So the government mandates that cities be built here and there and they are then bringing in people and jobs into those cities. Obviously this kind of stuff would never fly over here, the government can't go into the countryside and says: Oi! You! You go there and be quiet!\", it's just not how things work in Europe or in the US. But in China today, and at other times and places, that's how Communists do things.*\"Yes, those cities built 10 years ago have people in them now, but I can guarantee you that the price those people paid to move in was lower than the price the country spent to build, hold, and repair them\"*Far from it, they are likely multiple times higher but that's largely the effect of the Chinese property bubble.But really what I'm getting at is that, you don't need to have demand to build things because you can create the demand later. Private businesses in market economies don't do that on a massive scale because they can never justify the risks. But they do it on a smaller scale and try to reassure their investors with carefully crafted business plans and promises of high returns.The exception is when they have deep pockets and plan on losing money for a some time while they are creating the demand. That's the whole idea behind marketing, it's creating a demand that isn't there or changing one need into another need.When Apple launched the iPod, there weren't millions of people crying out for that product, the demand did not exist. More specifically, it was not formulated and Apple did that. Elements of that demand existed (the fact that people had to carry their CDs and mini discs around) but what Apple did is create a product and only then got people hooked on it using clever marketing.And by the way, have you ever heard of failed products and ventures? Every company's got them. Well yeah, those are instances where they fail to create the demand.Command and control governments like China essentially act as giant corporations with deep pockets and a monopoly. Their development is reminiscent of the strategy that was employed in my country, France, during the post war decades. The style of economic management was called \"dirigisme\". It produced some of the best infrastructure in the world, nuclear weapons, the most advanced civilian nuclear industry, Concorde the supersonic plane, the fastest train in the world, an ancestor to the internet, Ariane rockets into space etc etc...The Chinese government is essentially doing the same thing, trying to design the economy rather than letting it grow organically.",

And I'm not discounting prevailing trends, I'm saying the trend was obviously not there, was miscalculated, and while trends are useful, you don't spend money on a \"just in case\" future trend, you spend it on a current trend where you are fairly certain you will fulfill it when you're done. Just In Time is a critical aspect of business. You obviously have an economics education. I do as well. But I also have a business finance education, which either you are somewhat lacking, or maybe government economics just simply ignores, which is likely considering that governments don't spend their own money, and have no risk of failure or competition, and that's what you're following too.Yes, maintenance is what prevents entropy, and is what is not happening in these cities, thus their value is going down (I never said zero). Yes, those cities built 10 years ago have people in them now, but I can guarantee you that the price those people paid to move in was lower than the price the country spent to build, hold, and repair them. That's where weal is burned: even if the building do sell (if they don't they're a total loss), the money spent is still less efficient than if that money was spent to build them when they were actually needed. Even people who flip houses don't just buy houses just in case someone will need to move into them later, or sit on them for months or years. Maintenance is expensive. You only buy and repair when you know something will buy it back, or you sell at a loss, or you rent.I'm saying I'm not making guesses about the future because I'm only talking about what has happened and what is happening now, where the money was spent and the cities are sitting empty.

            "text": "+Rassa h*\"Houses built with no demand for them have no value\"*What makes you think there isn't a demand for it? There sure isn't one this minute or people will have already bought but demand includes anything in the foreseeable future, not just thing that happens this minute.Investing takes a bit of a forward outlook, if you produce something that is already hot, you aren't the first mover and will only get a small slice of the pie, or most likely, will be unable to sell. You have to analyse trends, not the current situation.As a side note, many companies produce things for which there is no demand whatsoever today. Their plan is to create the demand. This is a quite fundamental feature of modern commerce. It's not the 19th century anymore, today, companies are in the business of creating wants, not merely fulfilling needs.And we haven't even touched on the nature of demand in economics. People talk about supply and demand as if they were the same thing, only the mirror image. That's a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept and markets. Supply tends to be definite, I have something and I wanna sell it. Demand is far harder to gauge because a number of things can affect its size and shape of it. Demand is nothing more than future potential for suppliers and that potential is intimately tied to other factors (advertising, fashion tendencies, macroeconomic trends etc...)*\"saying that crystal balls are terrible\"*But that's exactly what you're doing by claiming a city built in China has no value. You discount all the prevailing trends: You simply look at the fact that no one is moving in these cities and deduct that no one ever will.Wild guesses and crystal balls are not the same as analysing a trend and projecting yourself in the future.*\"What you seem to forget or ignore every time I mention it is entropy\"*Because there is something called maintenance. It nullifies it at a fairly low cost and buildings last decades.Again, you were wrong in your assumptions for artificially created Chinese cities 10 years ago, they were in exactly the same situation. completely empty and according to you, of a value of zero. Today, they are bustling metropolis. What is to say you're not making the same wrong assumption now? And how can you say you are not making guesses about the future after that?So yes, you ARE talking about future depreciation based on, frankly, a quite simplistic notion that if you can sell right now, you never will.",

            "text": "+AldjinnTVPolitical correctness is not an ideology, it means exactly what it say; that what you say/believe/do can either be benificial to you in a socio-political sense or harmful, and the same stuff that is PC to you may be extremely un-PC to your ideological opposite. For example, one of the most politcally correct people in america right now is donald trump, sure what he says would make most sane decent people never vote for him, but to those who lap all that racist/jingoistic/blowhard bullshit up it only makes them love him more. To me he is politically INcorrect, to them he is very politically correct, even if theat's not how they would describe it.*The Moar You Know!..*",

It was investigated for 3 years by a Republican led Committee and they found ZERO on Hillary. The Secretary of State does not and should not make security decisions best left to security professionals. The lightening speed of the attack and the fact that our Ambassador even so got to the panic room without a scratch means the system worked. He unfortunately died of smoke inhalation in a hospital hours later because the contractor didn't put in the auxiliary ventilation generator. It was terrible, but the Ambassador was well aware that every other consulate had left and chose to stay despite security warnings. A brave man committed to his job, as were the 3 CIA officers who violated protocol to try to help him (not knowing that he was \"safe\" in the panic room. A tragedy - absolutely. A strike against Hillary - no way.",

Is that not exactly what corporate tax cuts are? Are these tax cuts given to them without the gimp? No.......But your dinesh way of framing it is also correct, no it's not welfare.... but you're being intentionally misleading here you see?Maybe it seems like we are when we say it, but we come from a context of understanding th3 issue to begin with so we don't actually think anyone will be mislead, because on our saide we tend to understand the issue in more detail and would not be mislead by something like that.........That's not even to say it's EVEN misleading at all ANYWAY",

You have your beliefs to back you up. This is why you troll. You have no real arguments just emotion. You are afraid of the way the world is changing and you think the orange clown will stop the change you don't like. You are too gullible or stupid to see he's nothing but a con-man. I feel sorry for you in a way, you cause your own problems and blame them on the rest of the world. And win or lose that guy you think you know will say \"sucker\" to you after the election. You will be worse off either way. If Hillery wins you will be bitter and bitch about how much better it would have been \"IF\". If the clown wins you will be even worse off but you'll blame it on everyone else just like now. No one will want to be around a bitter old troll so you will also be lonely and likely kill yourself possibly taking some innocents with you just to be noticed.

            "text": "+Miranda N Cancer is a problem because immune system cannot tell the difference between most cancer cells and normal cells. Boosting immune system does little for cancer. This is a fact. For this reason, vast majority of small molecules found in nature will do little for cancer.I'm not saying all homeopathic treatments are bad. One time a certain homeopathic treatment combined with certain dietary practice significantly outperformed conventional drug treatment for epilepsy. In this case, it's not that the pharma producing conventional epilepsy drug was oppressing alternatives. It's just that the study into the alternative was on-going and incomplete. Now that many studies have concluded, the current conventional treatment for epilepsy includes ketogenic diet combined with new drugs that are more effective and specific.But you are somewhat misguided in your last point. In many cases, pharmas isolate small molecules found in nature, revise their chemical composition slightly to make it more effective or specific (for less side effect) and then patent it. So yeah, pharmas are interested in finding novel compounds in nature. They're just not interested in those that show little promise and certainly not in snake oils. Also a ton of research studies are NOT done by pharmas, but rather by institutions and universities who have no interest in monetary gains.",

            "text": "+Woo Cheol Shin Homeopathy has not been suppressed by the gov't / pharma companies / scientists *because homeopathic products can be lab-created and patented for profits*. An official move toward regulating it in the US and UK began only recently when the public consumers' complaints against it were accumulating. Also, homeopathy uses the identified harmful substance in each case to allegedly trigger the patient's immune system to counter the disease, which is a fundamentally different mechanism than those discussed in the linked documentary above.Unlike homeopathy and other synthetic drugs, the herbs, baking soda, etc. are sourced directly from the nature and cannot be patented. They are cheap and unprofitable. It's because of the suppression that the lab scientists have been able to market their synthetic drugs & therapies as \"the only legitimate treatments\".I'm not saying that we have full scientific understandings of the alternatives such as Essiac etc. It's precisely because there's a lack of interests & research from the mainstream scientific community in the field of non-profitable medicines, that i want people to pay more attention to it. The situation is analogous to the historical suppression & criminalization of marijuana. The suppression has benefited the prison-industrial complex & pharma companies & the right-wing politicians (targeting the minority electorates). The more research you do, the more you realize those plants are not only relatively safe but also beneficial and effective against many health problems.",

A parents who gives orange juice and prays cannot be punished but someone who gives orange juice and just hopes is. That is all about religious beliefs. Praying is not a medical treatment nor are children the property of their parents. A parent cannot decide over the life and death of the child.These are easy cases with completely curable diseases. Hard cases where the child could suffer and there would be no hope of getting better are different things. Still I would hope the parents leave religious outside their considerations as irrelevant,",

Brits sold Irish kids to the colonies, plantation owners. Why do you think the White population of the South has mainly Irish ancestry? They did not migrate there out of free will to work on the plantations... Slavery was an economic system. Slavery was widely practiced by the Africans and it was actually the African tribal leaders who sold their own people and their prisoners of war into slavery to Arab and Jewish slave traders.Native Americans had slaves as well as there was slavery in the Muslim world. Slavery in the Muslim world was on a much bigger scale than in America but I don't see anyone demanding compensation from the Saudi or Egyptian government. Why? Because Muslims castrated their African slaves. Slavery has never been a race issue. In ancient Rome and Greece slaves were mainly whiter (Slavic and Germanic people) than the slave owners. Guess what there is a reason why the words Slav, Slavic and slave have the same root.As for the Asians. Being racist is totally acceptable in Asia. It doesn't mean they beat Blacks in the streets in China or Japan but they have their preferences and Asian societies are way less inclusive than Western ones. Asians clearly prefer their own race to others.",

Why? because we overproduced domestically and glutted the marker. China in response saw the writing on the Wall and devalued their own currency as a counter. They had to shut down 2/3 American run factories in China for the simple reason that Americans are too poor to even buy their crap at Walmart anymore. The oil destined for China now sits in America doing NOTHING. So you never wondered why we didn't go back to $4 a gallon and instead dipped closer to $2.50, even though you still believed your false paradigm? WAKE UP.",

I guess that's nothing to you? Piece of cake, you could have done that, right? Sure.And you don't seem to understand the difference between debt and deficit. You first have to bring the deficit down to zero before debt stops growing. A country is not like your private bank account. Any spending is stretched out over years. So you can't just cut the deficit to zero over night. Bush left office with the highest deficit in US history and Obama worked 6 years to bring it down again. Which he accomplished. If he continues like this for the next two years we can have a surplus again like we did under Clinton.It's funny how conservatives keep accusing the democrats of being big spenders yet Bush and even Ronald Reagan have both blown up the deficit like while Clinton and Obama have reduced it.

Wikipedia: \"In 1991 Cenk wrote an opinion in the The Daily Pennsylvanian that the massacres of Armenians during the First World War in the Ottoman Empire did not constitute genocide,[17] a view he repeated in a letter to the editor of Salon in 1999.[18] In a blog post in April 2016, he rescinded the statements made in the earlier letters, saying he was young at the time and doesn't now know enough to comment on the genocide.[19]\"A quick search through the online archives of The Daily Pennsylvanian will show you the article, with a picture of Cenks face next to it. He explicitly denies the Genocide. As you see, later on he said he was young at the time, but he still didn't admit it was a genocide. He simply says he still \"doesn't know enough to comment\". Yeah right. Cenk denies the genocide. If you can't find it online you are not looking hard enough. Do you even know where the name of the channel comes from? The channel is named after the perpetrators of the genocide. \"The Young Turks were the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide. The Young Turk Movement emerged in reaction to the absolutist rule of Sultan Abdul-Hamid.\"https://www.tytnetwork.com/2016/04/22/rescinding-daily-pennsylvanian-article/",

The Palestinian retards shoot rockets into civilian areas and then israel hits the tsrget from where it came, it keeps happening so they take more land. It's not complicated. Want a 2 \"state\" solution, bearing in mine that palestine is NOT a state, then have the Palestinians push Hamas out of their land to pursue a peaceful agreement. Progressive's solution is to hate israel, just look at the comments, basically all nazi pieces of shit.

Scared of a little karma coming to bite you in the arse in the modern era. If you are so paranoid that the Muslim down the street is gonna bomb your house or rape all your women or that your Mechanic or neighbourhood hobo is an illegal immigrant than go ahead and call the police. They've shown how they've degenerated into attack dogs capable of execution only rather than to protect. But you wouldn't mind non American being harmed would you, wether they're guilty or not. I can understand your lack of empathy of \"them\". You know, people who aren't like you or the people you actually know. People who are so damn foreign to you that you can imagine that they can possibly be better than you, or smarter than you, or kinder than you.

That's real when bureaucracy stands in the way of American born citizens being barred from the voting booths because of factors in their life situation and that their access to proper identification are harshly impaired compared to more well off citizens. There are states in the south that. have actively undermining the voting rights act that guys like MLK fought and died for. This election suddenly, thousands of voters were purged from the vote for a number f reasons including identify verification issues. So calm your ass when you see some shooter happening to be an illegal immigrant or that he'd voted illegally. Unless you are implying that all illegal immigrants (which America was built on I'll remind you) are diabolical and planning on killing everyone, than try and before guy talk the way you do.",

The fact that you keep insisting that falsehoods are true\", bla bla.I wasn't insisting on that, just saying what I think. Nothing is set in stone, you're treating it like I have a very rock solid position on this lol, my position from the start is generally that he has wayyyyy! less money than he says, and less than a billion, and maybe more than he inherited after inflation etc. But probably not.Also the comment above me explained the rest.",

They would not have went to Bush anyway.\"There were also only so many liberal votes to go around. \" So what? The number of liberal and Democrat votes that went to the Democrat candidate Clinton is irrelevant and has nothing to do with the conservative and republican votes that went to Perot or Bush.  Bush lost because a large number of conservative and Republican votes went to Perot that would have normally went to Bush. If those conservative and Republican votes went to Bush instead of Perot then Bush would have won. Perot's conservative and Republican vote percentage was greater then any liberal and Democrat contribution to Perot. Bush only needed 6% more to win. Perot took more then that in conservative and Republican votes. Bush 37.5% + Perot 18.9% is far greater then Clinton 43.0%. Bush would have won if Perot had not run.To bad, so sad. ",

Wait a minute.  I thought you hated socialism?  I guess government bailing out banks does not count as socialism in your eyes.Ben Bernanke is as establishment as it gets.  You trust Ben's take on the Depression, but you don't trust textbooks.  Bahahaha!!!!  Of course he is going to have a conservative take on economy and the Great Depression.  You need to go one step further and instead of just saying that government is the problem and it is corrupt.  You have to ask a follow-up question which is \"who corrupted the government?\"  the answer is the financial industry.  So it is no surprise regarding Bernanke's stance. ",

The number of instances in which Islam is used as justification for violence FAR OUTWEIGHS the handful of instances you can find where Christianity is used to justify violence.  This is because the language used in the Quran can more easily be interpreted to justify violence.  There are passages that explicitly state it's justified to cut off the heads of nonbelievers.  Mohammad himself was a warlord.  Look into it.  You will be hard pressed to find a similar message in the Christian Holy Bible, which is based on the teaching of a pacifist.My biases are based on facts - reality.  Is Christian terrorism a global threat, or is Islamic terrorism a global threat?  Your bias that every single religion is identical - where the hell did you get that from?  It's ridiculous.",

Israel tried to play nice, they where allied to Iran up tell the Islamic revoultion, After the revoultion, Iran kicked Israel out of their embassy and gave it to the PLO. Then right after they did that Iraq invaded Iran, and guess who the PLO sided with? Yes Iraq, the PLO backed the Iraqi invasion of Iran. Guess who saved Iran in the war? Israel did. Israel was there single largest source of weapons of technical support. Almost every other country sided with Iraq, but Israel bailed Iran out. Iran couldn't find a reliable source of weapons of any other country. Iran would have lost the war without Israeli weapons, and Israeli advisers on the ground. Iran also supports groups like Hezbollah, and Hamas who attack Israel. So Iran can cry me a river about a few engineers. Iran picked this fight, and Iran is the one the keeps it going.",

Hillary Clinton was the only person on the ballot in Michigan and delegates ended up being being split in a way that had nothing to do with popular vote. A such, your argument that Michigan should be included in Hillary's vote totals makes abolutely no sense. By any reasonable measure, Barack Obama won the popular vote in 08. And that's not just me saying that, it's simply a verifyable fact. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/democratic_vote_count.htmlAlways funny to see Clinton supporters act like you can dismiss facts simply by disagreeing with them.",

Today it is not the America that was started when the Founders fought for independence. *INDEPENDENCE*, my exact ideas. \"Love it or leave it\", ha?

I have seen no statistics that say police officers have a higher chance of dying in a traffic accident than any other profession that involves lots of driving.

            "text": "+K4316 You're mistaken on this account. I'm not sure where you've learned this history that you've come to understand, but Mosaddegh took emergency power over the Iranian parliament, stripped the Shah of executive powers and centralized decision making to himself.This is a simple timeline:1: Mossadegh attempts to nationalize Iranian oil, removing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's (AIOC, now BP) privatization of the Iranian oil resource.2: England pulls all AIOC workers, leaving inexperienced Iranians to work the fields. This caused a drop in oil production, but since the oil was now nationalized, the country was still obtaining greater wealth.3: After England worked to try to recover the deal over Iranian oil, Mossadegh declares England an enemy of Iran and cuts all diplomatic relations.4: England imposes sanctions on Iran, setting up blockades to prevent Iranian imports and exports. England captured at least one oil tanker, citing the oil as \"stolen goods.\" This stopped the export of Iranian oil.5: The British look to US help to resolve the matter. Then Secretary of State in the US Dean Acheson rebuked England's \"rule-or-ruin policy\" in regards to Iran. It was also stated that the new nationalization agreement in Iran benefited the US greater than the AIOC did.6: In the background of all of this, local Iranian politics were coming to a head. The relationship between Mossadegh and Kashani (Islamic cleric and backer of Mossadegh) became strained; Kashani blaming Mossadegh for not adequately establishing an Islamic state and Mossadegh for causing political instability in the country. This caused an erosion of support from the Islamic nationalist community for Mossadegh -- one of the biggest, if not the largest, supporters for both his position as PM and for oil nationalization.7: Mossadegh had successfully obtained privilege from the Iranian Parliament for emergency powers. He continually eroded the Shah's influence in politics by banning the Shah from engaging in foreign diplomacy, limiting funds and continually removed political power from the Shah.8: The people of Iran, both Islamic nationalists as well as anti-nationalists were against him (and even the less polarized citizenry against him with the economic hardships that the nationalization of Iran's oil had brought on the nation). This was, in part, due to key Iranian citizenry and politicians cooperating with British intrigue as part of Operation Boot. The larger issue was the British sanctions and blockades.9: Mossadegh had his emergency powers extended for another 12 months.10: With Einsenhower now taking presidency, the English leadership was finally able to convince the executive branch in Washington to join in Operation Boot.

The poor are at a severe disadvantage and we have a Government that has never seen the power they hold in our entire history.. When people are allowed to keep the fruit of their labor, everyone wins.. Ever hear of the saying, a high tide raises all ships? Second, the cost of living for the average individual is at an all time high. This is due to government policies that have devalued the currency, such borrowing and debt. The individual is empowered under Libertarian philosophy. The corporation is empowered under government rule. There can be economic justice without the need for government. The two are not at all exclusive.",

On a side note, youtube actually fakes a lot of it's view count because it's a big business and has no regulation or motive to prevent it from faking numbers to stay the number 1 video website on the internet.  I know this for a fact because a channel that I work on suddenly went from 4k views to 170k and youtube stats showed a bunch of fake stats that was literally not possible.",

I watch most of their videos, and I watch on a daily basis, but I'm not interested in following Cenk on Twitter. Not everyone uses Twitter as a news source. TYT also has the most subscribed trolls I've ever seen, anywhere. Many people see a video and hit Like & Subscribe but then hardly ever come back, or just don't have the time to view all 10 or so daily uploads. Many people also abandon their accounts for some reason or another after a couple years. There are many reasons why there are not as many views as subscribers.

            "text": "+EnderZ13 - All Cenk does is spew his opinion. He doesn't care about facts. By the time he adds, takes away and gives his awful opinion the story almost changes to a degree that we can't recognize it as the same story. I find that with every story, but I have stopped watching his video's now. The most I do is read the description box and that is always wrong too. I can give examples of previous videos such as the video about Christians and atheists getting divorces. He was determined to brainwash people that Christians had much lower morals, and he did that by making the claim that Christians had more divorces than atheists. He quoted stats from an atheist site and even the atheists told the truth. He didn't. He withheld the proper information from the very site he used, lol.. Of course, I went to another polling site to checkout the facts as well. The lie was that the site said they really couldn't say who had more divorces. The reason was that the Christians (some) had got their divorces before converting to Christianity, so they viewed that as an atheist divorce, but did go ahead and quote the numbers as they were. However they said the numbers were not the bottom line since the Christians were atheists when they got divorced. Cenk never mentioned that. That is the kind of things he constantly does. He will show a partial clip of something and cut the part that he doesn't want seen and heard too. The stories he reports are so doctored up, cut, etc.. that he will change an entire meaning and out come. I don't respect him one ounce. It's like he wants things to be a certain way so badly that he will alter a story to suit himself. I guess the idiot actually thinks we will take him at his word and never look for facts beyond him. Instead, I quit watching him completely. Always and I do mean always check into other sources to get the \"real\" truth or you will cheat yourself.",

            "text": "+bjbell52 Ha, private prisons are not the problem, government MONEY in private prisons is the problem. The economy was crashed with government regulating money supply, fixing price of money, inflating bubbles and preventing economy from working its way through restructuring of the bubbles. Sure, it's the Fed, it's pseudo-government, yet the Fed never goes against government desire to print more and to provide bailouts and to lower interest rates despite creating gigantic inflation (which is only invisible as long as other countries are absorbing it into their economies while providing the USA with the goods that they make, but that is going to stop now, especially given that China decoupled from the dollar last month).What you should be afraid of is not somebody who understands the problems in the economy. You should be afraid of yourself, while you don't understand the economy you believe that your collectivist ideology is above such earthly concepts as free market price discovery. Eventually free market price discovery wins, doesn't matter if it takes a few years more or less, then your collectivist ideologies inevitably fail as is evident time and again throughout history. Even recent history shows how worthless collectivism is for long term economic stability, never mind how it destroys lives of hundreds of millions, while more capitalism and freedom in the market turns a former pro-communist Chinese economy into the most productive one in the world.",

These are the rabid spawn of the southern strategy gutting the republican party from within. There are far more views than likes or dislikes, that means the majority of viewers are just watching the videos to form an opinion not to troll the comment section, and if they do read the comments then that definitely doesn't help trump seeing as most of his supporters are politically incoherent and very antagonistic to any criticism of the great pumpkin. Between trumps own outlandish behaviour and his supporters vitriolic attacks on channel employees and opposition comments, I don't believe that trump has near the support that you fear he does. Of course hitlery is no great prize either, and skeletons in her closet could very well sink her.

            "text": "Sorry Trump fans.  There is absolutely no way Trump gets the nomination.  The republican establishment would rather have Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump.  Many republican congressmen have said they'd vote for Hillary in a Trump, Clinton matchup.You think they're going to be worried about splitting the party by choosing Kasich?First - Trump stands no chance against Clinton.In a matchup between Clinton and Trump in the electoral college, Clinton is guaranteed 260 electoral votes to Trump's 109.  You need 270 to win the nomination.260-109 in a race to 270 with 169 undecided? If  Clinton wins 1 mid size state, she wins.  If she wins 2 small states, she wins.   Trump would have to win every single tossup state to win.  It's impossible.  Trump stands zero chance.  He'd be the weakest candidate in history.  So what do they care if they rip the party in two by nominating Kasich, if the alternative is a guaranteed loss anyway?  Especially since they would rather lose to Clinton than have Trump win the presidency!!!Against Kasich, Clinton is guaranteed 214 electoral votes, Kasich is guaranteed 256.214-256 in a race to 270.  Kasich smashes Clinton.  He's all but guaranteed a win.And maybe that pisses off Trump and Trump runs as 3rd party - but what does it matter, if Trump was guaranteed to lose anyway, and if they would prefer Clinton to Trump?The republican party will nominate John Kasich in convention.  Guaranteed.Republicans may be slime balls, but they're not stupid.",

I don't know about you, but I use vehicles to travel, the \"killing\" thing is what we call an accident, since it's not what they were made for. And to go even further, when we make cars, we think about safety. So even when we get in accidents, we try to keep the people inside and outside of the vehicle alive...Guns are made to keep people alive? Are they made to travel? Are they made to cut food? No, they're made to shoot and kill. That's it.And that's just 1 part of your comment that made no sense. The rest of your comment is even more ridiculous and simply factual inaccurate.So please spare me the bullshit arguments",

Heres some statistics- by taking a random sampling of people, putting them in controled groups you rule out other external variables. In this case if you took two groups randomly chosen, feed one group healthy food and taken their IQ, Then had the other group eat nonhealthy food then take their IQ ect...If the groups were properly chosen at random then the other forces would be ruled out, there should be as many good parents in one groups as the other, there should be as many as (whatever) as the other. The only factor would be the experimental variable.The problem with these type of experiments and the reason why we hear \"coorelation and causation\" argument is the liberals love to try and find patterns. Group people up, find a pattern in something, call it a problem and then force everyone to solve that problem.",

            "text": "+DarKool81\u200b\u200b +dookdawg214 Exactly. In order to have evidence of causation one must know most, if not all, of the factors involved and produce a mechanism by which to understand how these factors work in tandem to produce a cause. Finding a correlation is literally useless unless you can provide evidence that one is causing the other. There's a reason why the post hoc fallacy is one of the most pervasive fallacies in existence. My main contention is not that the study fails to provide sufficient evidence that there is a causal link between diet and intelligence; my problem is that TYT doesn't even mention it and declares conclusively that there is a causal link. At best, it is a display of ignorance and shows a lack in critical thinking skills; at worst it is intellectual dishonesty. ",

And the burden of proof is on the researchers to show that there's a real causation. Did this study identify a biological or physiological mechanism by which higher levels of preservatives have a detrimental impact on neurological activity or cognitive ability? I just scanned a summary of it and I see nothing related to that. All they did was find a correlation. It is much more likely that less-educated (and, correspondingly, less intelligent) parents are less likely to practice good nutritional habits with their children. As a result, you'll find a higher concentration of less-intelligent children who consume fast food. Whether this is the case or not is irrelevant. The fact is, as long as it's a realistic possibility, then it's up to the researchers to correct for this. The burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that there is a real causation.",

Look at Apple their baseline phones costs less than 50$ to make, as a person who works in the field of biology and have pretty strong knowledge on the cost of drugs for example they cost near nothing compared to the selling price. Your knowledge on the how the medical field is awful, most of the drugs are so impure and and shit, you have no idea.They get pushed on the market most of the time before they even get proper amount of trials.The whole red tape you talk with the FDA, is so that there is accountability to your action when you kill someone, but I guess you don't give a shit who you kill if you can make profits.",

But when the people coming over have a specific ideology that causes them to murder people who are not like them, its a dangerous combination.

Its time to draw a line in the sand and let them know the hard way that the rest of the world doesn't give a shit about their ancient goat herder ideology. Why should we? What have they done lately? Any new discoveries, scientific advancements or inventions? Nope. These people are 100% useless in a modern, civilized society. Over a billion Muslims and not even 1 measly nobel peace prize.

You understand what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Ehrlichman continued.*\u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d*",

Do you know what else America is definitely number 1? The rate of incarceration. There is more people in American jails than anywhere else in the world including Iran and China.If you really want to expand your horizons and learn about other countries, you should watch the new film by Michael Moore \"Where to Invade Next.\" I watched Moore do interview about the movie and it was so hilarious I wanted to watch it right away before it comes out on Netflix. I watched it last week. I thought I knew a lot about Europe and there were things in the film that blew my mind. Like Italians get 7 week paid vacation a year. (I didn't mistype, that's seven weeks paid vacation - seven and sometimes they get eight). And when Michael Moore tells Italians that there is no guaranteed paid vacation in the US and there is no maternity leave, they didn't believe him. Or in Slovenia everybody has free higher education, so that Americans come to have education there because they have 100 courses in English. And government encourages people from other countries to come and study there.But hey you would never want to watch that film. Your conservative brain is going to explode! LOL! ",

Everyone has their own definition of the moment that the government has become tyrannical, so some of the populace will be government loyalists who love it, some will be people who dislike government but aren't at the threshold of of an insurrection, some will like certain programs but dislike others, and some will be in full Revolution tilt. So what if I am not really a fan of the government in general, but I stick up for a government program? Would I become the mortal enemy of the revolutionaries? Once this threat was out there, I'd have to defend myself, right? So now there's crossfire chaos between different gradations of unrest. A fully-armed populace would just lead to citizens shooting each other over the disagreements that they had about whether or not to shoot at the government. There's no way that this concept would ever have worked unless you happened to have a government so flagrantly evil that it unified its entire opposition.",

The differences in the denominations are very inconsequential.\"Then you just shot yourself in the face with that statement. So then the ones you said weren't \"True Christians\u00ae\" Actually ARE \"True christians\u00ae\" You can't have it both ways. You can't say they are and aren't in the same breath.\"They all  agree on fundamental Christian doctrine otherwise they are not a denomination but a Christian cult.\"Again, who are you to say how they follow it is the riogfht way? Do you have some \"Magical connection\" or special know;edge that NO ONE ELSE posses that shows that YOU are 100% correct! Please show us your magical mathematics to show who is and isn't according to your magical thinking. \"This is very simple and logical to follow.\"Religion and logic have nothing to do with each other. \"Most of what you just wrote is trolling.\"Trolling? You responded to me, that makes YOU the troll here. \"I'm judging who is a Christian?\"Yes. Did you not say: \"It's like how Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses call themselves Christians but aren't\"That is judging who is and who isn't based on what YOU believe. Typical christian retard, denies saying he is the one who is judging who is a christian and isn't then caught in their lie. You are a dishonest pile of shit.\"lol the text defines a follower of Christ.\"No, it doesn't. You believe a bunch of stores written by uneducated goat herders that were too ignorant to know where the sun went at night or thought that \"bats are birds\". \"The Holy Spirit had sex with Mary? lmao you must be really bored I see.\"Where did I say \"Holy spirit\" I said: You think that a god had sex with a women to give birth to himself to sacrifice himself to himself save us from him for a mistake he made instead of just simply saying \"Hey, I forgive you\" which is sickening to think that someone or something else has to die for your so called \"sins\" which aren't even real to begin with.See I said god. Not holy spirt. Besides that how you buybull puts it. Wow, you don't even know your own mythos. Which goes to show that I know your buybull and your beliefs as an atheist better than you do as a believer. You better hope your imaginary sky wizard isn't real. Cause seeing how you got so much wrong, Id be worried if I were you. But since I don't believe in your crap, I'm not. ",

All religions are cults. \"This all has to do with whether they follow fundamental Christian doctrine or not.\"No, it doesn't, it has a lot more on how far they carry their cultish beliefs. Again, all christians are cultists. \"Jesus made it clear\" Snip Who? Just kidding. Yes I am aware of the myth of jebus. But citing a mythical person to bolster your case isn't proof of anything. \"People think fundamental Christians are wackos like fundamental muslims.\"Do you have any idea what your religion was like before? Yes, they are the same in that regards. \"I think\"Thats your first mistake, you aren't thinking. \"when most like yourself think of fundamental Christians you are actually thinking of Christian cults.\"Again, all christians are cults. Just because you don't like the way they practice your religion or follow it more to what the buybull actually says, then you call them \"cults\" not realizing that you are also part of that same cult. The only difference her is how far you decide to take your beliefs. \"Like Westboro Baptist Church. They are fundamentalist but are beyond that in being a Christian cult.\"As much as I despise the WBC, they do follow they beliefs of the bible a lot closer than you do. That makes you the weaker cult here, not the stronger one. \"As soon as they cross that line and become a Christian cult it's not even right to call them Christian anymore technically.\"And who decides this? You? Thats called a no true scotsman fallacy BTW. You can't point to them and say \"They aren't True Christians\u00ae\" because they practice your religion differently than you do, which is the same one.\"It's like how Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses call themselves Christians but aren't\"Again, No true scotsman logical fallacy.\"when such Christian cults deny the very person of God Jesus.\"This just shows your ignorance of the way they practice their beliefs I'm an atheist, and I know they also believe in Jesus, they just put him in a different position. And how do you know that jesus is god? Because YOU believe that? \"You could probably care less\"Then you really don't know what that statement means do you? That means that I still do care, even if its the littlest of bits. When it comes to your cult, I do care a whole lot in fact. I care about keeping your cult beliefs out of my schools and government. I care about how your cult is being used to persecute gay people. I care about how your cult is being used to go after people like me that don't believe in your magic sky wizard and trying to force your beliefs down our throats. To say I could care less, shows you don't have a clue what I care about. \"but someone might take something out of that.\"Yeah, I did take something out of that. Here's a list.1. You use logical fallacies to put your beliefs above other's beliefs.2. You don't care about facts of the history of your own religion. You want to believe that your religion has been nothing but smiles and puppy dogs. 3. You feel the need to believe that you are the ones being persecuted and yet still have no problem persecuting others.4. You think you get to decide who is a \"christian\" and who is not based solely on what you believe. 5. You don't have any idea what a cult is based on.6. You think that the bible is the arrant word of god because your belief teaches you that jebus is a magical sky wizard. 7. You think that a god had sex with a women to give birth to himself to sacrifice himself to himself save us from him for a mistake he made instead of just simply saying \"Hey, I forgive you\" which is sickening to think that someone or something else has to die for your so called \"sins\" which aren't even real to begin with.Did I mess anything?

They failed on reporting the life and record of Bernie Sanders (ideas, issues, politics, votes in favor and against, controversies, etc). Same thing with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. They don't talk facts. They just want ratings and they love everything how it is because it benefits the rich. And they are the rich.",

Of course, youll also have to throw Bush and his warmongers in there for enacting the patriot act and  170000 counts of murder (all the victims of the iraq war, the soldiers where led to iraq under false pretenses. If you convince the cops to raid a home under false pretenses and someone gets killed in the process, you are charged with murder. Obviously 9/11 is a day that should not matter to anyone, the only thing that made 9/11 special is property damage. You think the people in those buildings mattered? Think again, if as few lives as theirs would matter to us, we wouldve forgotten about 9/11 after a month given the death toll of world hunger)",

            "text": "+Lyle Belken Let's explore all the possibilities. Let's pretend that Trump wins presidency which is extremely unlikely because you need a lot of minority votes and Trump has already pissed off Hispanics, Muslims, blacks, women, Asians. You need at least 40% of Hispanics to win presidency. Republican Party is freaked out that Trump will be a nominee coz they will be killed in general elections. But let\u2019s pretend that Trumps is going to win for the augment\u2019s sake.1)* Trump can't deport 11 million illegal immigrants because you need to have a budget of $500-$600 billion* to do that. It will put the US into recession. Never mind that it's inhumane and cruel which Republicans DGAF about. 2) *Let\u2019s pretend he deports all illegals and then what?* How\u2019s that going to address income equality, climate change?  They tried the same thing in Arizona when employers were punished for hiring illegal immigrants and the fields were full of rotten fruits and vegetables. There were nobody there to pick them up. Americans won\u2019t pick up fruit in scorching heat for c50/hr. If that ever happened, then a carton of orange juice would cost you $20. America is addicted to cheap labor and it's not going to change in the future. The cost of deporting all illegals and blow to agriculture will be a complete disaster.That's just Trumps positions on immigration, Trump wants to invade all Muslim countries. Bush\u2019s foreign policy was major clusterf#ck and Trump wants to do more of the same.*If Hillary becomes president she won't change anything.* She will just change the current system and make it a tiny bit better. She doesn\u2019t want to address anything that Bernie\u2019s campaign is pushing: progressive taxation, Wall Street reform, corrupt campaign finance system, trade deals. It will be just a band aid solution. The country will still go on the trajectory set up by Ronald Reagan: rich people are getting richer and poorer people are getting poor. Peoples are angry now, imagine how angry they will be in 4 years from now. And that can\u2019t continue indefinitely, when peoples\u2019 anger reaches critical mass there will be 3 possible dramatic outcomes:1) Peaceful political revolution. Progressive president like Bernie will be FDR 2.0 and fix the problems the way they were fixed in 1930s.2) Violent political revolution. Violence will erupt in the likes of Russian or French revolutions.3) United States will have a fascist state like Nazi Germany which will also be very violent and we all know how well that ended.",

Too bad that Bernie is 75, so he most likely won't run in the next elections but he can ask Clinton to make Elizabeth Warren (or any other progressive) to be her VP. Majority of young people are liberal and Bernie gets 85% votes of young people, it tells you that millennials are the most liberal generation. It tells you that Democratic Party is split and it also tells you about the future and direction of Democratic Party. Hilary needs young people\u2019s vote in general elections. If she wins presidency and doesn't do anything after making bunch of promises, there will be a progressive challenging her during next presidential elections in 4 years. No reasonable person takes Hillary for a true progressive and progressives won't have patience to wait for Hillary to \"evolve\" on the issues that Bernie is pushing.",

            "text": "+b belly You're guessing that blacks receive harsher sentences because of recidivism. That's conjecture. I guess you'd gravitate towards that conclusion if that's what you want to believe. But we KNOW that police target, harass, and convict blacks at a greater rate for the same crimes. Most of those crimes are non-violent/drug related. So, any way you cut it, blacks are being imprisoned unjustly. I won't argue with you that police target the poor. I also think race comes into it, but mostly because police are told to target certain minorities because it leads to more convictions. So, why do certain minority groups commit more crime? Economic instability is probably most of the reason. But when you've got police breathing down your neck every day, stalking your neighborhoods looking for trouble, well, you know what they say about looking for trouble. It's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Poor communities breed crime > police assume black people in said communities are criminal > many black people get convicted for bullshit offenses > distrust and hatred is sown between law enforcement and citizenry > black people behave badly > police react by harassing black people without probable cause... and so on.I'm not sure we really disagree on much, but i guess we're interpreting statistics differently. I don't think racism is as huge a problem as some claim. To me, it's mostly a problem with racial profiling and poor police training. As I see it, racial profiling is not a helpful practice, as illustrated above.",

            "text": "+Global Warming SkepticWell you're right. It's a mistake to think that one solution solves all problems.Going from LA to New York by train is just silliness! It's a route that is much better served by air.And it's a gargantuan project, the US government can't even deliver the mail profitably, what are the chances it can oversea a project of that magnitude.As for private ventures, I don't think too many have the appetite for this type of thing. In any case, even if it is a public project, it will be public-private as they all are around the world.The price of the ticket would be so expensive that it would never complete with the plane, therefore it's the dumbest idea ever. It would become a vanity project like the French/UK Concorde supersonic flights to New York (not sure if you're old enough to remember them).Similarly, there are tons of projects for Maglev trains going short distances. It's just stupid, people want to save an hour or two on medium distance routes and have a more comfortable ride, not 15 minutes going to the airport and pay triple the price. There are much cheaper conventional solutions for that.But when it comes to linking major cities that are only a few hundred miles apart, then high speed trains really make sense. The best example in the US is LA to San Francisco. With a TGV or an ICE, it would take 2h30 city to city. With a Maglev, it would be half that.Now that would make sense!",

            "text": "+LerkeroAnd I told you again clown, the article that Jonthaan Robin just wrote is completey copycat from the author of Clinton Cash. In the report, they are bitching about how much charity money goes to the causes, and they claim that most of the money goes toward Clinton family and their stuff without having any evidence what so ever, but in reality 88% donation goes to cause. This whole article is nothing but speculation from right wing author.Maybe when you have fucking clue who wrote the piece, and they have no prove but to just make random shit up, the fact that you believe that's the truth which proves that you are nothing but imbecile who get feed what right wing Jonathan Robin tells you. Now you go fuck off and stop being pathetic twat.",

It sounds more rhetorical question to me. And also irrelevant. What does my age, disposition, or personal belief system have to do with the assertion that not everyone in the film industry is an actor, and not all actors are paid to be pretty, ergo, calling them 'models' is bullshit? I'll give you a hint: nothing.  And should I indulge you in a red herring? No. My point is indisputable: casting agents and directors are not \"paid to be pretty\" and no one cares or should care what shoes they wear, and a lot of the women turned away were old women who CAN'T wear heels for medical reasons, and telling them they can't attend unless they wear things that are dangerous to wear is just cruel. Is that a \"feminist\" statement or not? You figure it out. I'll call it a CORRECT statement. The mic has been dropped.",

Most people are just doing what they've been taught and don't want to change because they want the same results they saw the people before them achieve.

Reason for that is that America is the only Country where those initiating litigations and lose in Court don't have to pay the opposing sides legal costs. Armies of lawyers are attacking anyone they can hoping for settlements, which is a form of legal extortion. As for Watergate, the reason Nixon resigned was that he was too honest, too ethical and not politicized the DOJ, just like the rotten Obama has done",

            "text": "+Ali ShamsianToday, I rescind the statements I made in my Daily Pennsylvanian article from 1991 entitled, \u201cHistorical Fact of Falsehood? When I wrote that piece, I was a 21 year-old kid, who had a lot of opinions that I have since changed. Back then I had many political positions that were not well researched. For example, back in those days I held a pro-war rally for the Persian Gulf War. Anyone who knows me now knows that I am a very different person today.I also rescind the statements I made in a letter to the editor I wrote in 1999 on the same issue. Back then I had a very different perspective and there were many things that I did not give due weight. On this issue, I should have been far, far more respectful of so many people who had lost family members. Their pain is heart-wrenching and should be acknowledged by all.My mistake at the time was confusing myself for a scholar of history, which I most certainly am not. I don\u2019t want to make the same mistake again, so I am going to refrain from commenting on the topic of the Armenian Genocide, which I do not know nearly enough about.Thank you for being patient with me on this issue, though I might not have always merited it.  -Cenk Uygar",

That problem is that it's also a greenhouse gas, and it's concentration in the atmosphere is growing very fast. That means Earth is warming up. That's in itself not a big deal, it happened before. The big deal is the speed of the change. What used to take thousands, or millions of years, now happening in decades. That's way too fast, the biosphere can't adapt. That's going to cause mass extinction. The other problem is that the stuff we eat are also living things that need a specific climate to grow. For example if there is too much rain, it washes away the soil, so our crops die. If there is too little, or crops dry out and die. Than we can't feed our domestic animals, so they die too. And because of ocean acidification fish die too. That means no food for us. That leads to mass migration and wars. And also some of the biggest cities on the planet might have an issue with rising sea level.",

No one ever said that all atheists are unafraid of death but rather that they're less afraid of it and accept it as something that's inevitable. Religious folks on the other hand choose to deal with death as though it's just a start of a new afterlife.

I know she has said she wants a $12 minimum wage, but then later said if a $15 minimum wage crossed her desk she would sign it. The outrage is that Hillary is that Hillary isn't \"liberal enough\" even though a $12 minimum wage would put us on track with what the more liberal side of Europe has. They often say this would only catch us up to Europe even though, at least in the case of minimum wage, it would put us left of Europe",
